Stagflation is when there is high inflation, high unemployment, and slow or negative real economic growth\u2014a world that is triply uncomfortable. Traditionally there are two periods in the 1970s that economists have defined as stagflation, 1974-1975 and 1978-1982. Both periods overlap with recessions.", "Although there are different rationales for the causes of stagflations, my perspective is that the primary cause is poor monetary policy by the Federal Reserve when the Fed does not adequately account for how inflation and the real economy respond to changes in its policies. Specifically, both statistical and visual examination of the historical data indicate unemployment, economic growth, and inflation do not immediately respond to changes in the Fed\u2019s policies. For example, after the Fed starts a restrictive monetary policy to bring inflation down, these variables will continue in their prevailing direction for a while; for example, inflation continues to rise, the opposite of what the Fed wants. Ultimately, these variables will change course and inflation will fall, exactly what the Fed wanted, but only after a two- or three-year lag. When the Fed does not properly take these lags into account, it can lead to periods of stagflation.", "Stagflation is when there is high inflation, high unemployment, and slow or negative real economic ", "Many conjecture that our current economic situation will devolve into stagflation, with high unemployment with high inflation. We have the inflation for it, and that is not going to go away for a while.

Although these shocks could have made the situation worse, either directly pushing inflation higher and the economy deeper into contraction, or indirectly via the Fed\u2019s response to the shock, I consider monetary policy to be the root cause of stagflation.", "The $30 Billion Kitty: Meet The Investor Who Made A Fortune On Pet Food", "Chairman Xi, China\u2019s Looming Crisis, And The Myth Of Infallibility", "Meet Private Equity\u2019s Quiet Corporate Turnaround Artist", "The role of monetary policy in causing stagflation is a little more complicated. Preceding each of the stagflations was a period of contractionary monetary policies. We can see this by observing rising fed funds rates prior to each stagflation. The fed funds rate, the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend their Federal Bank reserves overnight to each other, acts as a key metric we can use to measure the Fed\u2019s monetary policy stance. A rising fed funds rate is indicative of contractionary monetary policy because higher interest rates make it harder for companies and individuals to borrow; therefore, companies invest less, and households reduce spending. The Fed uses contractionary policies to bring inflation or an overheated economy under control. ", "The critical factor behind stagflation is that there are lags between when the Fed increases the fed funds rate and how economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation respond. Of the two stagflation periods examined here, the average time between when the Fed started raising the fed funds rate and inflation started to decline was just over three years. Economic growth and unemployment responded more quickly, on average two years after the Fed started tightening its policy,", "A convoluted example of this is what occurred prior to the stagflation of the early 1970s. At that time the fed funds rate was declining, which, taking the lags into account, led to declining unemployment and rising economic growth in 1972 and subsequently with rising inflation in 1973. But the story did not end there. To counteract the rising inflation caused by its earlier actions, the Fed reversed its policies, increasing the fed funds rate in 1973. This led to rising unemployment during the stagflation period of 1974-1975, when it averaged ", ", and slowed economic growth, which averaged ", ". But, because of its lagged response, inflation was still responding to the earlier monetary expansion, so it averaged ", ". Hence, stagflation. A similar result to this played out in the other stagflation period.", "Whether we will have a reoccurrence of stagflation in the near future depends on how quickly monetary policy tightening will bring down inflation relative to how quickly it will cause unemployment to rise and economic growth to fall. ", "The Fed has just begun tightening its monetary policy by raising its fed funds target rate from 0.25% to 0.50% and it plans to continue to increase it to ", " through 2023. Raising the fed funds rate by what amounts to 2.55% over a two-year period is not excessive, given the current level of inflation. In fact, these rate increases are minor compared to previous Fed actions when inflation has been high. One of the lessons of the 1970s is that when inflation is high, the rate increase also must be high and stay high. ", "The reason inflation persisted through the 1970s is because the rate increases by the Fed were neither sufficiently high nor persistent enough to bring inflation down. Using the first stagflation of the 1970s as an example, even though the rate increase was larger than the rate of inflation, it was still not sufficient to bring down inflation because the Fed quickly followed its increase with a rate decrease, even before inflation had responded to the initial rate increase. Because of the lagging response involved, inflation continued into the next stagflation. ", "Assuming the Fed\u2019s policy is sufficient to cause changes in the real economy, it is possible that unemployment will not rise, and economic growth will not fall until late 2023. Inflation will continue to rise after this initial rate rise perhaps until late 2024, if even then, before it starts to decline. This assumes no other intervening economic events that could cause economic growth to fall or inflation to persist, such as the recent oil price shock or the Russia-Ukraine war. Furthermore, a critical question is, will unemployment rise, and economic growth fall enough to cause stagflation? ", "Many think we are heading into a period of stagflation because they disagree with the conclusion I discuss in the previous paragraph. Rather, they ", " a recession will occur sooner rather than later. We need to keep in mind that economists are horrible at predicting recessions, and that means no one can know for sure if stagflation is ahead.

Stagflation is when there is high inflation, high unemployment, and slow or negative real economic growth\u2014a world that is triply uncomfortable. Traditionally there are two periods in the 1970s that economists have defined as stagflation, 1974-1975 and 1978-1982. Both periods overlap with recessions.", "Although there are different rationales for the causes of stagflations, my perspective is that the primary cause is poor monetary policy by the Federal Reserve when the Fed does not adequately account for how inflation and the real economy respond to changes in its policies. Specifically, both statistical and visual examination of the historical data indicate unemployment, economic growth, and inflation do not immediately respond to changes in the Fed\u2019s policies. For example, after the Fed starts a restrictive monetary policy to bring inflation down, these variables will continue in their prevailing direction for a while; for example, inflation continues to rise, the opposite of what the Fed wants. Ultimately, these variables will change course and inflation will fall, exactly what the Fed wanted, but only after a two- or three-year lag. When the Fed does not properly take these lags into account, it can lead to periods of stagflation.", "Stagflation is when there is high inflation, high unemployment, and slow or negative real economic ", "Many conjecture that our current economic situation will devolve into stagflation, with high unemployment with high inflation. We have the inflation for it, and that is not going to go away for a while. But as this article will discuss, the question is whether the Fed has errored in its policies and therefore are we going to go into a recession, thus adding the other part of the stagflation equation.", "Economists debate what causes stagflation, but for the most part, it is seen as a combination of ", ", such as oil price shocks, and ", " occurred during each of the stagflation periods and expansionary monetary policies preceded each.", "Because each stagflation was concurrent with an oil price shock, the shock was not the root cause of the stagflation. Although these shocks could have made the situation worse, either directly pushing inflation higher and the economy deeper into contraction, or indirectly via the Fed\u2019s response to the shock, I consider monetary policy to be the root cause of stagflation.", "The $30 Billion Kitty: Meet The Investor Who Made A Fortune On Pet Food", "Chairman Xi, China\u2019s Looming Crisis, And The Myth Of Infallibility", "Meet Private Equity\u2019s Quiet Corporate Turnaround Artist", "The role of monetary policy in causing stagflation is a little more complicated. Preceding each of the stagflations was a period of contractionary monetary policies. We can see this by observing rising fed funds rates prior to each stagflation. The fed funds rate, the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend their Federal Bank reserves overnight to each other, acts as a key metric we can use to measure the Fed\u2019s monetary policy stance. A rising fed funds rate is indicative of contractionary monetary policy because higher interest rates make it harder for companies and individuals to borrow; therefore, companies invest less, and households reduce spending. The Fed uses contractionary policies to bring inflation or an overheated economy under control. ", "The critical factor behind stagflation is that there are lags between when the Fed increases the fed funds rate and how economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation respond. Of the two stagflation periods examined here, the average time between when the Fed started raising the fed funds rate and inflation started to decline was just over three years. Economic growth and unemployment responded more quickly, on average two years after the Fed started tightening its policy,", "A convoluted example of this is what occurred prior to the stagflation of the early 1970s. At that time the fed funds rate was declining, which, taking the lags into account, led to declining unemployment and rising economic growth in 1972 and subsequently with rising inflation in 1973. But the story did not end there. To counteract the rising inflation caused by its earlier actions, the Fed reversed its policies, increasing the fed funds rate in 1973. This led to rising unemployment during the stagflation period of 1974-1975, when it averaged ", ", and slowed economic growth, which averaged ", ". But, because of its lagged response, inflation was still responding to the earlier monetary expansion, so it averaged ", ". Hence, stagflation. A similar result to this played out in the other stagflation period.", "Whether we will have a reoccurrence of stagflation in the near future depends on how quickly monetary policy tightening will bring down inflation relative to how quickly it will cause unemployment to rise and economic growth to fall. ", "The Fed has just begun tightening its monetary policy by raising its fed funds target rate from 0.25% to 0.50% and it plans to continue to increase it to ", " through 2023. Raising the fed funds rate by what amounts to 2.55% over a two-year period is not excessive, given the current level of inflation. In fact, these rate increases are minor compared to previous Fed actions when inflation has been high. One of the lessons of the 1970s is that when inflation is high, the rate increase also must be high and stay high. ", "The reason inflation persisted through the 1970s is because the rate increases by the Fed were neither sufficiently high nor persistent enough to bring inflation down. Using the first stagflation of the 1970s as an example, even though the rate increase was larger than the rate of inflation, it was still not sufficient to bring down inflation because the Fed quickly followed its increase with a rate decrease, even before inflation had responded to the initial rate increase. Because of the lagging response involved, inflation continued into the next stagflation. ", "Assuming the Fed\u2019s policy is sufficient to cause changes in the real economy, it is possible that unemployment will not rise, and economic growth will not fall until late 2023. Inflation will continue to rise after this initial rate rise perhaps until late 2024, if even then, before it starts to decline. This assumes no other intervening economic events that could cause economic growth to fall or inflation to persist, such as the recent oil price shock or the Russia-Ukraine war. Furthermore, a critical question is, will unemployment rise, and economic growth fall enough to cause stagflation? ", "Many think we are heading into a period of stagflation because they disagree with the conclusion I discuss in the previous paragraph. Rather, they ", " a recession will occur sooner rather than later. We need to keep in mind that economists are horrible at predicting recessions, and that means no one can know for sure if stagflation is ahead.

He points to rampant new construction nationwide, with so many buildings springing up that 600,000 new units came to market last year \u2014 nearly double the previous record. Meanwhile, those federal stimulus checks that fattened renters\u2019 wallets have been mostly spent and price increases for other necessities, like energy and food, are competing for their remaining dollars.", "\u201cI am absolutely programming for a major correction,\u2019\u2019 says Finger. That\u2019s why this past December he sold half his portfolio \u2014 15,000 units in Houston, Dallas and Atlanta \u2014 to real estate investor Greystar for $2 billion. He thought it was a rich price, equal to about 33 times expected 2022 net operating income (rental income minus expenses) of $60 million. Figuring the package would have fetched some 75% less before Covid-19, Finger concluded, \u201cit would be irresponsible not to sell.\u201d ", "Yet while Finger was a happy seller, Greystar was a happy buyer, says Kevin Kaberna, its investment director, who admires Finger\u2019s vigor and calls him a \u201cprolific developer of the nicest assets in best locations.\u201d With 54,000 units in Houston, Greystar was already the biggest landlord in town and Kaberna insists the market remains fantastic \u2013 he points out the nationwide vacancy rate is down to 5.2%, the lowest in at least 20 years, with outright shortages in the hottest markets.

Finger received an early discharge from the Army after a disorder led to most of his stomach being removed. In his early 20s he learned from mentor Ben McGuire how to combine loans from insurance companies with mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration to build two-story, wood-frame, brick veneered apartments with 100% financing. \u201cYou really could fully leverage them, without any equity at all,\u2019\u2019 he marvels.", "After successfully building dozens of middle-class apartments, Finger almost lost his shirt on his first office building project, which became one of the infamous \u201csee-through\u201d towers that languished empty, with unfinished interiors after the 1982 oil bust. He resolved to stick with apartments but decided to venture beyond the edges of Houston\u2019s endless sprawl\u2014going all the way to Chicago, where he met attorney Barry Nekritz. \u201cThe thing that made Chicago interesting to him was that it had the best transportation network in the country. You could get on a train and into the city and live near a food store,\u2019\u2019 says Nekritz. In Schaumburg, Illinois, Finger\u2019s contractors are now putting finishing touches on a new mid-rise complex located nearby an older (but still nice) one he put up 35 years ago.

Chip Douglas, who ran Harvard\u2019s real estate investments back then, recalls Finger\u2019s pursuit of \u201cthe art of building with quality and making the numbers work.\u201d At one building \u201che didn\u2019t like how the pool turned out so he ripped it up and started over.\u201d After a decade, Finger bought out most of Harvard\u2019s interest, but that prestigious relationship opened doors to all the capital he would ever need. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know Finger from Adam, but they sure as hell knew the Harvard seal,\u2019\u2019 Finger says.", "Since then, the builder has signed on other big name equity partners, including Houston billionaire Fayez Sarofim and the children of the late pipeline tycoon Dan Duncan. He has also built bigger, taller projects, such as the Museum Tower in Houston, appraised by Harris County at $100 million. ", "Along with tapping Texas money, Finger has built off his deep Houston connections. In 2006, he heard from his daughter Jill Jewett, then head of cultural affairs for Houston Mayor Bill White, that billionaire Rich Kinder was working with the city to build a city park called Discovery Green that would transform downtown. Forewarned, Finger scooped up a lot and set to work on a 340-unit high rise called One Park Place that would overlook the new park. Eyebrows raised; there hadn\u2019t been a residential tower built downtown in 20 years. He kitted it out with a replica of the pool at the Ritz-Carlton in Maui and lured a high-end grocery store to the ground floor. \u201cThe number one amenity is a food concession,\u201d he says. Still, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, tenants were hard to find, and it took years to fill the units. \u201cI never thought about risk on that project,\u201d he says now. The building is valued at $158 million. As Houston boomed post-Great Recession, he followed up with a string of luxe projects like the eight-story 500 Crawford, across from Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, and now appraised at $91 million. No vacancies. ", "Finger likes to daydream about what might someday replace the 20 acres with 540 garden apartments at the Creole On Yorktown that he built in the early 1970s with financing from Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns. It was the first and last time he ever incorporated an on-premises bar (a security nightmare). He almost lost the complex to bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, \u201cbut nobody wanted to buy a negative cash flowing property.\u201d Eventually, \u201cHouston\u2019s market did turn,\u201d and he\u2019s owned it ever since, with the tony Galleria neighborhood growing up around it. After the next oil bust in the early 1980s and the savings and loans crisis, Finger picked up some gems at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed to liquidate the failed S&Ls. His purchases included a three-acre parcel in the Galleria where he built a modest complex (valued at $10 million). The site, now adjacent to an Omni Hotel and the tony Houstonian Golf Club & Spa, could someday yield to a redevelopment worth many times that. ", "In late 2019 Finger raised $90 million to erect a new luxury tower on another nearby plot. But he called the project off even before Covid-19 hit, concerned that an inverting yield curve signaled economic trouble ahead. With today\u2019s high demand, that building would have filled up fast, but he doesn\u2019t regret pulling back. \u201cThe fundamentals have to make sense.\u201d When they do, Finger (plus heir apparent daughter Jill and son Edward) has the land on which to erect a number of high-rise redevelopments. He\u2019s in no hurry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now can\u2019t last,\u201d he says, referring to the rampant construction of apartment buildings. In Houston, for example, builders currently hold permits to build 42,000 units, more than twice the normal number. Prices for labor and materials are surging. Having seen bubbles before, Finger is content to wait. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get overbuilt again. The glut is definitely coming.\u201d "]},

Collins pulled up to an altitude of 30,000 feet and began accelerating. I watched closely the air speed gage in front of me. As it eclipsed Mach 1, I could not help but think of the late Chuck Yeager, who died in December, and all of the research and bravado that went into his record-breaking Bell X-1 supersonic flight in 1947.

Then the forces hit me, and pretty quickly. It was as if the lights were on, and then out. After we settled back down, Collins asked how I felt. Nauseous, for sure, but I didn\u2019t know if I had blacked out. Then came the bad news: We had only hit 8.6 Gs! Did I want to try again, Collins wanted to know. What the hell, I thought, when would I ever be in this position in the future, so I told him to go ahead. Again, the quick G onset, and then it was over. I felt even more disoriented, and nauseous, but this time had a big smile 0n my face. We had indeed reached 9 Gs, and I was now a member of that elite club.", "USAF Lt. Col. James \"Face\" Collins with an F-16D at Eielson AFB, Alaska, March 2022.", "After our flight, I interviewed Collins back at the base. He told me that I had done pretty well.

Which is why he says, \u201cI think what I\u2019m holding on to is worth more than what I\u2019m selling.\u201d ", "Finger grew up in an entrepreneurial family. In the 1940s his father Hyman moved from the piney woods near Beaumont, Texas and started Finger Furniture.

Finger received an early discharge from the Army after a disorder led to most of his stomach being removed. In his early 20s he learned from mentor Ben McGuire how to combine loans from insurance companies with mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration to build two-story, wood-frame, brick veneered apartments with 100% financing. \u201cYou really could fully leverage them, without any equity at all,\u2019\u2019 he marvels.", "After successfully building dozens of middle-class apartments, Finger almost lost his shirt on his first office building project, which became one of the infamous \u201csee-through\u201d towers that languished empty, with unfinished interiors after the 1982 oil bust.

Forewarned, Finger scooped up a lot and set to work on a 340-unit high rise called One Park Place that would overlook the new park. Eyebrows raised; there hadn\u2019t been a residential tower built downtown in 20 years.

Still, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, tenants were hard to find, and it took years to fill the units. \u201cI never thought about risk on that project,\u201d he says now. The building is valued at $158 million. As Houston boomed post-Great Recession, he followed up with a string of luxe projects like the eight-story 500 Crawford, across from Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, and now appraised at $91 million. No vacancies. ", "Finger likes to daydream about what might someday replace the 20 acres with 540 garden apartments at the Creole On Yorktown that he built in the early 1970s with financing from Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns. It was the first and last time he ever incorporated an on-premises bar (a security nightmare). He almost lost the complex to bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, \u201cbut nobody wanted to buy a negative cash flowing property.\u201d Eventually, \u201cHouston\u2019s market did turn,\u201d and he\u2019s owned it ever since, with the tony Galleria neighborhood growing up around it. After the next oil bust in the early 1980s and the savings and loans crisis, Finger picked up some gems at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed to liquidate the failed S&Ls. His purchases included a three-acre parcel in the Galleria where he built a modest complex (valued at $10 million). The site, now adjacent to an Omni Hotel and the tony Houstonian Golf Club & Spa, could someday yield to a redevelopment worth many times that. ", "In late 2019 Finger raised $90 million to erect a new luxury tower on another nearby plot. But he called the project off even before Covid-19 hit, concerned that an inverting yield curve signaled economic trouble ahead. With today\u2019s high demand, that building would have filled up fast, but he doesn\u2019t regret pulling back. \u201cThe fundamentals have to make sense.\u201d When they do, Finger (plus heir apparent daughter Jill and son Edward) has the land on which to erect a number of high-rise redevelopments. He\u2019s in no hurry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now can\u2019t last,\u201d he says, referring to the rampant construction of apartment buildings. In Houston, for example, builders currently hold permits to build 42,000 units, more than twice the normal number. Prices for labor and materials are surging. Having seen bubbles before, Finger is content to wait. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get overbuilt again.

Frizz. Damage. The hair industry is practically built on promising to fix all of those common hair conundrums. But how many products actually do? After a career spanning many corners of the beauty industry, Melisse Shaban knew the real deal when she saw it. That\u2019s how Virtue came about. The brand is now celebrating its fifth anniversary with their very first commercial, voiced by Virtue devotee and investor Jennifer Garner, who was introduced to the brand by her stylist, Adir Abergel. ", "\u201cWhen I became Creative Director of Virtue back in 2017, I naturally wanted to share all these incredible products with my friends, family and clients,\u201d Abergel says. \u201cMuch like my own experience with the brand, Jen became a fan after seeing the results on her own hair, which is why a partnership makes so much sense\u2014she was already a consumer. Nothing makes me happier than bringing smart and strong women together. Melisse Shaban is someone I respect immensely and bringing her together with Jen is a dream. When you are super busy, you need products that do what they say. Jen was able to see results immediately when she used Virtue. Because of that, this is authentic collaboration where she can share her experience with women and men everywhere.\u201d", "Garner was so enamored with the brand that she\u2019s traveled to company headquarters to learn all about the science behind it. \u201cI became interested in working with Virtue when Adir\u2019s passion for the products turned to trial turned to love,\u201d Garner says. \u201cYou can like the smell of a shampoo or the feel of a conditioner, but those coming along with hair changing science of Alpha Keratin 60kU make Virtue undeniable. As soon as I used Virtue I noticed more volume. Even before the new hair growth that followed, my hair was thicker. Over time, I can tell my hair is less tangly, more absorbent, shinier and bouncier\u2014my ponytail is bigger.\u201d ", "Practically born into the beauty business, Shaban\u2019s father worked in the industry and her first job was at a beauty counter at Macy\u2019s in Herald Square in New York City. From there she rose through the ranks, putting in time at The Body Shop, StriVectin and other major brands. She wasn\u2019t looking to create one of her own, but about eight years ago she got a phone call about new technology. \u201cAs we've heard many times before in the cosmetic industry, this technology is going to change the world,\u201d she says. She took a meeting and learned how scientists had developed the process to extract keratin from hair. Initially, the technology had been developed to help people suffering from traumatic injury as part of regenerative medicine, when they realized the keratin would help repair damaged hair. ", "8 Fall 2021 Trends To Start Wearing Now", "How Meghan Markle\u2019s Style Has Changed Since Leaving Her Royal Duties", "Tula Skincare Launches Their First Brand Campaign To Fight Negative Self-Talk", "\u201cWe went into third party clinical testing and did a placebo-based test to make sure that the cosmetic ingredients were doing the heavy lifting, because at the end of the day, the world doesn't need another haircare line,\u201d Shaban recalls. \u201cThe data was off the charts; it was insane. The protein was actually filling the exact size and shape of where the damage site was. We don't coat the hair\u2014we actually fill the keratin back in and the hair sees it as hair. That started our journey.\u201d", "Derived from human hair, the Alpha Keratin 60ku protein is the cornerstone of Virtue, which blends biochemistry into every bottle to heal hair, across every hair type and concern. The brand started with one protein and now has eight, which they manufacture themselves at their own facilities in North Carolina. Shaban says one of the biggest hurdles of launching the line was producing the protein at an accessible price. \u201cIt took us almost four years to figure out a way to get it into production; it's very difficult to work with, very finicky,\u201d Shaban says. \u201cIt's fascinating how it's made from actual hair that we bleach in giant vats.\u201d", "Melisse Shaban, Founder and CEO of Virtue", "Since they\u2019re all about science, Virtue considers itself a biotech company, not a haircare company. \u201cThis came out of extraordinary amounts of research and development in an effort to make drugs and devices for regenerative medicine,\u201d Shaban says. \u201cAll of the underpinnings of this company are built around biotechnology and things that you would never do in a cosmetic company. First of all, it's a wash off product, so who would spend $75 million to make something you wash off. The technology is highly patented. We don't make a product unless the product is made better by the protein.\u201d Their eight proteins are used in different combinations for different reasons. For example, they recently launched a hair growth line that uses a unique combination to quell inflammation in the scalp. ", "\u201cWhat I have learned by working with our alpha keratin technology is that it works on every single hair type and texture to repair damage,\u201d Abergel says. \u201cThis is something that I have never experienced before with any ingredients or hair care product. Our technology doesn\u2019t see hair type or ethnicity at all. It just sees damage. So really, Virtue is for anyone who wants to experience their healthiest hair possible. The minute that I share it with anyone, it changes their relationship with their hair.\u201d ", "Virtue\u2019s products deliver results both immediately and over the long-term. \u201cIt has progressive benefits; you continue to get healthier hair,\u201d Shaban says. \u201cIt does exactly what it says it does and that's gratifying in this industry.\u201d That\u2019s the theme of the brand\u2019s first commercial, which is launching across all of their existing digital channels, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Display, on-site and email. It will later roll out in select regional markets throughout the second half of the year. ", "\u201cThe campaign is around having your best hair humanly possible, and the protein is agnostic\u2014it doesn't see demographic, it just sees damage,\u201d Shaban says. \u201cJen saw the commercial and it touched her because it is about discovering this protein eight years ago and imagining if everything we said we could do in haircare we actually did and what was really humanly possible. She said I have to I have to be the voice of this campaign. I can bring this to life for us.\u201d", "As for the next five years of Virtue, and beyond, Shaban\u2019s goal is for the company to continue to innovate. \u201cI\u2019d really like to be a brand that helps people with hair loss,\u201d she says. My mom suffered terribly with that and I watched her confidence go away. With true health and wellness issues, scalp and hair challenges, I'd like us to be the premier resource for those solutions. And I do think the science deserves its due. It was a lot of time, effort and blood and tears shed on getting it to work.\u201d"]},

As a backseat passenger, I wasn\u2019t flying the plane. So with my feeble \u201cyes,\u201d Collins began putting into place the air maneuvers needed to achieve our desired 9-G result while I sat strapped in the cockpit wide-eyed, like a crash-test dummy, waiting to employ what G-mitigating moves I had acquired.", "Forty-five minutes earlier, we had taken off with full afterburners from remote Eielson Air Force Base just below the Arctic Circle near Fairbanks, Alaska, rocketing up to 9,000 feet in just a few seconds.

The next goal: To break the sound barrier. Truth be told, I had been supersonic four times previously - in a MiG-25 Foxbat, an English Electric Lightning, the Concorde and that F-15, but each time was different - and enlightening. Collins pulled up to an altitude of 30,000 feet and began accelerating. I watched closely the air speed gage in front of me. As it eclipsed Mach 1, I could not help but think of the late Chuck Yeager, who died in December, and all of the research and bravado that went into his record-breaking Bell X-1 supersonic flight in 1947. Here we were breaking the sound barrier as a matter of course. How far we\u2019ve come.", "When we reached maximum speed, Mach 1.32, Collins radio\u2019d me.

More than 4,500 have been produced, in operation in several countries other than the U.S., including Pakistan, Turkey, Greece, Morocco, Israel and Bahrain. Several are now housed at Eielson, along with the newer F-35. The fighters are both air-to-air and air-to-ground attack aircraft.", "Back to the 9 Gs. As Collins counted me down, I began clenching my buttocks and employing the \u201check\u201d breathing maneuver (look it up) to keep blood flowing to my upper torso. Then the forces hit me, and pretty quickly. It was as if the lights were on, and then out. After we settled back down, Collins asked how I felt. Nauseous, for sure, but I didn\u2019t know if I had blacked out. Then came the bad news: We had only hit 8.6 Gs! Did I want to try again, Collins wanted to know. What the hell, I thought, when would I ever be in this position in the future, so I told him to go ahead. Again, the quick G onset, and then it was over. I felt even more disoriented, and nauseous, but this time had a big smile 0n my face. We had indeed reached 9 Gs, and I was now a member of that elite club.", "USAF Lt. Col. James \"Face\" Collins with an F-16D at Eielson AFB, Alaska, March 2022.", "After our flight, I interviewed Collins back at the base. He told me that I had done pretty well.

After a career spanning many corners of the beauty industry, Melisse Shaban knew the real deal when she saw it. That\u2019s how Virtue came about. The brand is now celebrating its fifth anniversary with their very first commercial, voiced by Virtue devotee and investor Jennifer Garner, who was introduced to the brand by her stylist, Adir Abergel. ", "\u201cWhen I became Creative Director of Virtue back in 2017, I naturally wanted to share all these incredible products with my friends, family and clients,\u201d Abergel says. \u201cMuch like my own experience with the brand, Jen became a fan after seeing the results on her own hair, which is why a partnership makes so much sense\u2014she was already a consumer. Nothing makes me happier than bringing smart and strong women together. Melisse Shaban is someone I respect immensely and bringing her together with Jen is a dream. When you are super busy, you need products that do what they say. Jen was able to see results immediately when she used Virtue. Because of that, this is authentic collaboration where she can share her experience with women and men everywhere.\u201d", "Garner was so enamored with the brand that she\u2019s traveled to company headquarters to learn all about the science behind it. \u201cI became interested in working with Virtue when Adir\u2019s passion for the products turned to trial turned to love,\u201d Garner says. \u201cYou can like the smell of a shampoo or the feel of a conditioner, but those coming along with hair changing science of Alpha Keratin 60kU make Virtue undeniable. As soon as I used Virtue I noticed more volume. Even before the new hair growth that followed, my hair was thicker. Over time, I can tell my hair is less tangly, more absorbent, shinier and bouncier\u2014my ponytail is bigger.\u201d ", "Practically born into the beauty business, Shaban\u2019s father worked in the industry and her first job was at a beauty counter at Macy\u2019s in Herald Square in New York City. From there she rose through the ranks, putting in time at The Body Shop, StriVectin and other major brands. She wasn\u2019t looking to create one of her own, but about eight years ago she got a phone call about new technology. \u201cAs we've heard many times before in the cosmetic industry, this technology is going to change the world,\u201d she says. She took a meeting and learned how scientists had developed the process to extract keratin from hair. Initially, the technology had been developed to help people suffering from traumatic injury as part of regenerative medicine, when they realized the keratin would help repair damaged hair.

The protein was actually filling the exact size and shape of where the damage site was. We don't coat the hair\u2014we actually fill the keratin back in and the hair sees it as hair. That started our journey.\u201d", "Derived from human hair, the Alpha Keratin 60ku protein is the cornerstone of Virtue, which blends biochemistry into every bottle to heal hair, across every hair type and concern. The brand started with one protein and now has eight, which they manufacture themselves at their own facilities in North Carolina. Shaban says one of the biggest hurdles of launching the line was producing the protein at an accessible price. \u201cIt took us almost four years to figure out a way to get it into production; it's very difficult to work with, very finicky,\u201d Shaban says. \u201cIt's fascinating how it's made from actual hair that we bleach in giant vats.\u201d", "Melisse Shaban, Founder and CEO of Virtue", "Since they\u2019re all about science, Virtue considers itself a biotech company, not a haircare company. \u201cThis came out of extraordinary amounts of research and development in an effort to make drugs and devices for regenerative medicine,\u201d Shaban says. \u201cAll of the underpinnings of this company are built around biotechnology and things that you would never do in a cosmetic company. First of all, it's a wash off product, so who would spend $75 million to make something you wash off. The technology is highly patented. We don't make a product unless the product is made better by the protein.\u201d Their eight proteins are used in different combinations for different reasons. For example, they recently launched a hair growth line that uses a unique combination to quell inflammation in the scalp. ", "\u201cWhat I have learned by working with our alpha keratin technology is that it works on every single hair type and texture to repair damage,\u201d Abergel says. \u201cThis is something that I have never experienced before with any ingredients or hair care product. Our technology doesn\u2019t see hair type or ethnicity at all. It just sees damage. So really, Virtue is for anyone who wants to experience their healthiest hair possible. The minute that I share it with anyone, it changes their relationship with their hair.\u201d ", "Virtue\u2019s products deliver results both immediately and over the long-term. \u201cIt has progressive benefits; you continue to get healthier hair,\u201d Shaban says. \u201cIt does exactly what it says it does and that's gratifying in this industry.\u201d That\u2019s the theme of the brand\u2019s first commercial, which is launching across all of their existing digital channels, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Display, on-site and email. It will later roll out in select regional markets throughout the second half of the year. ", "\u201cThe campaign is around having your best hair humanly possible, and the protein is agnostic\u2014it doesn't see demographic, it just sees damage,\u201d Shaban says. \u201cJen saw the commercial and it touched her because it is about discovering this protein eight years ago and imagining if everything we said we could do in haircare we actually did and what was really humanly possible. She said I have to I have to be the voice of this campaign. I can bring this to life for us.\u201d", "As for the next five years of Virtue, and beyond, Shaban\u2019s goal is for the company to continue to innovate. \u201cI\u2019d really like to be a brand that helps people with hair loss,\u201d she says. My mom suffered terribly with that and I watched her confidence go away. With true health and wellness issues, scalp and hair challenges, I'd like us to be the premier resource for those solutions.

It\u2019s a muscle car, like a Dodge Viper. It\u2019s got the thrust, turns great, is versatile in terms of the missions it can do. The F-35, on the other hand, is more like a very lethal Tesla. It has stealth characteristics as well as sensor fusion. In that F-16 today, your pilot was flipping through different displays to combine information for three-dimensional situational awareness. The F-35 lays all of that information over top of one display, fusing it. The F-35 also has really good acceleration. The engine is a beast. If you start at say, 200 knots, the F-16 and F-35 side-by-side using full afterburners, the F-35 will reach Mach 1 faster. It will also beat an F-22 to Mach 1.

The F-16 will also overtake the F-35 between Mach 1 and Mach 2. The F-35 actually maxes out at about Mach 1.7, fast enough to get the job done.

This has included launching testing facilities both at airports and in city-center locations across the UK, Asia and U.S., including at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) airport.

Yes, at times emergencies pop up and you need to use flexibility, but in most cases, you can plan events. If team members structure their work around their lives and then communicate this, people can find better balance and will feel like life and work are in harmony. Plan to go to the gym, plan to watch your kids' sports game or plan that daily nap. Then let people know you will be offline or when you will work. This structure will allow for freedom and understanding between team members, which will lead to better morale and an environment where people can trust each other no matter when people work. - ", "Punching a clock has never been the best way to measure productivity, nor has the simple act of sitting behind a desk in an office. Measure employee accomplishments by tracking outcomes and results; it is a more accurate and sensible way to check progress. Studies have shown that employees who work from home and make their own schedules are more productive than those who sit in an office for eight hours. By eliminating the commute to and from work, you eliminate reasons for missing work while creating even more incentive to get the job done from home.

Apps like Trello or Slack can help you stay up to date with multiple teams, and allow these teams to easily and quickly interact with one another, share assets and make notes. If you do not focus on communication and get it right, it is very easy for important tasks and even entire employees to get lost somewhere in the digital ether. Regardless of the time zone, you want to build into your workers habits of regular updates, check-ins and progress reports. This is another reason why finding the right software for your teams is essential, as the software you use can heavily dictate what these needs look like in practice. - ", "One of the biggest challenges when you have remote workers and flexible schedules is giving everyone a real sense of connection with your company. You don't want it to be just lots of isolated people doing their particular jobs, sending their work in and logging off. That can work for a while, but you'll find it hard to retain the best talent. To build a sense of community with people who may be far apart physically and even in different time zones requires some effort. Make sure everyone is able to communicate on multiple channels. Have virtual meetings at different times to accommodate people all over. Do what you can to encourage socializing. Have a purely social channel. In-person get-togethers are also good to build deeper connections. - ", "Do not underestimate the importance of hiring the right people. An asynchronous work style is awesome, but only for certain employees\u2014those who are self-motivated and disciplined enough to get things done without constant supervision. It's not just a question of skills; it's a matter of personality traits, values and mindset. Put extra time and effort into assembling a team of those who can function like that with no problem. - ", "One of the best ways to make an asynchronous approach work for everyone on your team is to indoctrinate the values that go hand-in-hand with asynchronous work into your company\u2019s culture and mission. By weaving the benefits and values of asynchronous work into the fiber of your company (like autonomy, productivity, efficiency, inclusivity, etc.), then you\u2019re more likely to see individuals thrive when adopting an asynchronous work style. It\u2019s doubly important when you\u2019re running a global and/or remote team. From recruiting to onboarding to training to annual reviews, if your business\u2019s policies embody the core benefits of this type of schedule, you\u2019ll witness how asynchronous schedules will work well for your company. - ", "In our workplace, we have stopped weekly \u201call-hands\u201d meetings where everyone has to attend and listen to the latest company updates. These meetings are often unproductive and they are inconvenient for people in different time zones, which is why we now do them every quarter instead of every week.

If you notice a dip in satisfaction and a rise in negative feedback, it\u2019s time to make a change. ", "Keep in mind that Net Promoter Score can vary by industry, so be sure to do your homework to find out the average score for your industry. ", "CSAT", "Another customer satisfaction metric you can measure is CSAT, or a Customer Satisfaction Score.", "A CSAT measures customer satisfaction with a business, purchase, or interaction. So, you could use your CSAT to get feedback on a variety of things (e.g., customer service, recent purchases, etc.). ", "Like with NPS, you typically ask one simple question to customers. For CSAT, you may ask something like, How satisfied were you with your experience? Survey scales can range depending on your preferences.

", "2. Pinpoint Problem Areas", "I might sound somewhat like a broken record, but here it goes: Customer satisfaction surveys are an A+ way to pinpoint problem areas and overcome customer issues before they snowball out of control. Why? Because they provide you with open and honest feedback.", "Let\u2019s face it\u2014as a business owner, negative feedback always stings a little. But, it\u2019s necessary if you want to make improvements and better your business. Your CSAT and NPS can give you insight into common problems or complaints, ways you can improve your product or service, and how you\u2019re doing as a business overall.", "So when looking at your scores, keep a close eye on the negatives. That way, you can see where your business is falling short and can make tweaks along the way to improve your metrics and customer satisfaction. ", "3. Reduce Churn", "No business owner wants to lose any type of customer. But sometimes (and sadly), it\u2019s inevitable. Not everyone is going to like your business and offerings\u2014and that\u2019s OK. However, you can use your customer satisfaction surveys to potentially reduce customer turnover and increase satisfaction. ", "The thought of customer churn may make you cringe, but it\u2019s something you absolutely need to keep in mind if you want your business to thrive. Not to mention, the cost of retaining customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones, so you want to do everything you can to hold onto the ones you have. Cue customer satisfaction scores.", "Your scores are a big red alert system for potential churn. But luckily, you can use them to catch an upset customer and (hopefully) reconcile the issue before they decide to leave for good. ", "So again, keep an eye on the negative scores/feedback you receive. That way, you can nip problems in the bud before they spiral out of your control (picture bad word of mouth, negative reviews, and disgruntled customers). ", "4. Increase Positive Reviews", "Your customer satisfaction metrics aren\u2019t only for pinpointing problems and turning frowns upside down. You can also use positive feedback from NPS and CSAT to ask happy customers to spread the word about your business in a good way.", "Pay attention to the positive feedback just as much as you do with the negative feedback and scores. For promoters (people who gave you an NPS score of 9 or 10), you can ask them to leave reviews for your business. Same goes for customers who give you top scores for CSAT (e.g., satisfied or highly satisfied). ", "Don\u2019t miss out on using positive feedback to your advantage, too. Sift through your positive ratings (hopefully there are a lot of them!) and reach out to those promoters or highly satisfied customers. Chances are, they won\u2019t mind sharing their experience and spreading the good news about your business."]},

Even though Zoom has become an asset for companies, many remote and hybrid employees battle \"Zoom fatigue,\" especially if attending online meetings is a big part of their workday.", "Members of ", " have also felt this struggle. Here, they offer their best tips on how to transform your next Zoom meeting into a more engaging endeavor for all.", "1. Set fun meeting themes", "One tip for transforming Zoom meetings into fun, engaging experiences for employees is to set themes for the meetings. Encourage team members to set custom backgrounds, don costumes, or even come up with nicknames to liven up the online atmosphere in a fun way that lightens the mood. \u2014", "Four New Microsoft Surface Computers Plus A Folding Phone\u2014And Other Small Business Tech News", "This Hot Esports Video Gaming Company Is Poised To Become A Major Player", "Championing Women In Business: A Conversation With Small Business Administration Assistant Administrator Natalie Cofield", "2. Encourage pet appearances", "This may seem like a silly idea, but it brightens up a team's day when a dog or cat decides to photobomb a webcam. Oftentimes, a pet will want attention, and an employee is obligated to either shoo them away or move the camera. Encouraging some attention will make the team happier and more likely to follow along with projects and projected metrics. \u2014", "3. Promote employee interaction", "You need to promote more interaction. No one likes being continually talked at. People in general are conversational and want to be included. Make sure questions and agenda are known in advance so that the meeting moves swiftly, and people can chime in with ideas or answers. \u2014", "4. Create engaging content", "When the pandemic hit, I had to think deeply about what it meant to remain engaging with my employees behind a screen. With a few ideas and some tweaking along the way, an epiphany hit me. Zoom fatigue isn't just a result of lockdowns or adjusting to screens\u2014we already look at screens eight hours a day; it's a lack of creating engaging content on the screen. \u2014", "5. Participate in round-robins", "Having a quick round-robin or something really light to engage everyone at the beginning and at the end of the meeting is usually very honest, and begins and ends the call with a good level of interaction. These simple and fun ideas put no pressure on anyone to perform during Zoom meetings. For instance, ask the team to switch off their cameras and then ask them what another person is wearing. \u2014", "6. Use Zoom's chat feature", "In our meetings, we tend to have little side conversations in the chat feature as the main meeting is going on. Usually, this happens very quickly and consists of jokes, conversations around what people are saying, and questions people have. It's a great way to engage people during Zoom meetings. So, don't shut down any chat conversations during meetings as they can create fun. \u2014", "7. Add a Q&A session", "You can make your next Zoom meeting more engaging by adding a small Q&A session to the end of the event. Use this time to answer your employees' questions and help them with any pressing issues. I've found that this part of the meeting is the most productive and engaging for us because it inspires conversations and helps us brainstorm new ideas. \u2014", "8. Keep meetings on a time limit", "Keeping Zoom meetings to 30 minutes or less is one way to combat Zoom fatigue. Sticking to a strict agenda on the call will help ensure you cover all topics in your meeting. \u2014", "9. Switch up meeting types", "The best way to combat Zoom fatigue is to get off camera. Do this by having different versions of meetings\u2014some that are voice only, some where the camera is optional, and then some meetings where the camera is compulsory. This will take some of the stress away. We save compulsory video calls for all-hands meetings and social events. \u2014", "10. Incorporate tangible exercises", "Striking a balance between on-screen and off-screen time is critical for maintaining energy and combating fatigue, but in this Zoom era, it can be hard to avoid. At your next Zoom meeting, try incorporating activities that rely upon physical worksheets or moments of reflection on physical paper. Doing so keeps the team engaged, without having to spend 100% of the meeting looking at the screen. \u2014"]},

Besides that, Saitex is aiming to produce fabrics that allow the laundry to use fewer chemicals by increasing the use of lasers. ", "All of this has come at a cost, undoubtedly.

Measure employee accomplishments by tracking outcomes and results; it is a more accurate and sensible way to check progress. Studies have shown that employees who work from home and make their own schedules are more productive than those who sit in an office for eight hours.

You don't want it to be just lots of isolated people doing their particular jobs, sending their work in and logging off. That can work for a while, but you'll find it hard to retain the best talent. To build a sense of community with people who may be far apart physically and even in different time zones requires some effort. Make sure everyone is able to communicate on multiple channels. Have virtual meetings at different times to accommodate people all over. Do what you can to encourage socializing. Have a purely social channel.

So, what exactly are NPS and CSAT? Let\u2019s get into it. ", "NPS", "An NPS, or Net Promoter Score, is a metric you can use for insight on customer loyalty and how likely they are to recommend your business to a friend or colleague. ", "Your NPS allows you to gauge how a customer feels about your business by asking one simple question: How likely are you to recommend Product XYZ to a friend or colleague on a scale from 0 to 10?

If you notice a dip in satisfaction and a rise in negative feedback, it\u2019s time to make a change. ", "Keep in mind that Net Promoter Score can vary by industry, so be sure to do your homework to find out the average score for your industry. ", "CSAT", "Another customer satisfaction metric you can measure is CSAT, or a Customer Satisfaction Score.", "A CSAT measures customer satisfaction with a business, purchase, or interaction. So, you could use your CSAT to get feedback on a variety of things (e.g., customer service, recent purchases, etc.). ", "Like with NPS, you typically ask one simple question to customers. For CSAT, you may ask something like, How satisfied were you with your experience? Survey scales can range depending on your preferences.

At Patriot Software, we currently have a CSAT of 84\u2014and we\u2019re pretty dang proud of it. But, we\u2019re always looking for ways to get to as close to 100 as possible.", "Your CSAT is a great way to quickly get feedback from customers. You can easily plant quick surveys in an app, on a webpage, or in an email to get feedback from customers.", "It\u2019s short and simple, and you generally get a high response rate because it\u2019s a single, easy-to-answer question.

Here are four ways you can use your scores to better your business (coming from a fellow business owner who uses both to make improvements on a daily basis). ", "1. Improve Interactions With Customers", "You can use both your NPS and CSAT to get valuable feedback from customers. Depending on what software or method you use, you can ask customers to provide additional feedback to go along with their rating. And then based on that said feedback, you can improve interactions with customers.", "For example, you can use your NPS ratings to find out ", "people prefer your business over a competitor. Then, use your findings to tweak interactions with prospective customers. Or, say you\u2019re using CSAT to find out how your business\u2019s customer service is. You can use your ratings to see where communication with your customers needs improvement.

", "2. Pinpoint Problem Areas", "I might sound somewhat like a broken record, but here it goes: Customer satisfaction surveys are an A+ way to pinpoint problem areas and overcome customer issues before they snowball out of control. Why? Because they provide you with open and honest feedback.", "Let\u2019s face it\u2014as a business owner, negative feedback always stings a little. But, it\u2019s necessary if you want to make improvements and better your business. Your CSAT and NPS can give you insight into common problems or complaints, ways you can improve your product or service, and how you\u2019re doing as a business overall.", "So when looking at your scores, keep a close eye on the negatives. That way, you can see where your business is falling short and can make tweaks along the way to improve your metrics and customer satisfaction. ", "3. Reduce Churn", "No business owner wants to lose any type of customer. But sometimes (and sadly), it\u2019s inevitable. Not everyone is going to like your business and offerings\u2014and that\u2019s OK. However, you can use your customer satisfaction surveys to potentially reduce customer turnover and increase satisfaction. ", "The thought of customer churn may make you cringe, but it\u2019s something you absolutely need to keep in mind if you want your business to thrive. Not to mention, the cost of retaining customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones, so you want to do everything you can to hold onto the ones you have. Cue customer satisfaction scores.", "Your scores are a big red alert system for potential churn. But luckily, you can use them to catch an upset customer and (hopefully) reconcile the issue before they decide to leave for good. ", "So again, keep an eye on the negative scores/feedback you receive. That way, you can nip problems in the bud before they spiral out of your control (picture bad word of mouth, negative reviews, and disgruntled customers). ", "4. Increase Positive Reviews", "Your customer satisfaction metrics aren\u2019t only for pinpointing problems and turning frowns upside down. You can also use positive feedback from NPS and CSAT to ask happy customers to spread the word about your business in a good way.", "Pay attention to the positive feedback just as much as you do with the negative feedback and scores. For promoters (people who gave you an NPS score of 9 or 10), you can ask them to leave reviews for your business. Same goes for customers who give you top scores for CSAT (e.g., satisfied or highly satisfied). ", "Don\u2019t miss out on using positive feedback to your advantage, too. Sift through your positive ratings (hopefully there are a lot of them!) and reach out to those promoters or highly satisfied customers.

Here, they offer their best tips on how to transform your next Zoom meeting into a more engaging endeavor for all.", "1. Set fun meeting themes", "One tip for transforming Zoom meetings into fun, engaging experiences for employees is to set themes for the meetings. Encourage team members to set custom backgrounds, don costumes, or even come up with nicknames to liven up the online atmosphere in a fun way that lightens the mood. \u2014", "Four New Microsoft Surface Computers Plus A Folding Phone\u2014And Other Small Business Tech News", "This Hot Esports Video Gaming Company Is Poised To Become A Major Player", "Championing Women In Business: A Conversation With Small Business Administration Assistant Administrator Natalie Cofield", "2. Encourage pet appearances", "This may seem like a silly idea, but it brightens up a team's day when a dog or cat decides to photobomb a webcam. Oftentimes, a pet will want attention, and an employee is obligated to either shoo them away or move the camera. Encouraging some attention will make the team happier and more likely to follow along with projects and projected metrics. \u2014", "3. Promote employee interaction", "You need to promote more interaction. No one likes being continually talked at. People in general are conversational and want to be included. Make sure questions and agenda are known in advance so that the meeting moves swiftly, and people can chime in with ideas or answers. \u2014", "4. Create engaging content", "When the pandemic hit, I had to think deeply about what it meant to remain engaging with my employees behind a screen. With a few ideas and some tweaking along the way, an epiphany hit me. Zoom fatigue isn't just a result of lockdowns or adjusting to screens\u2014we already look at screens eight hours a day; it's a lack of creating engaging content on the screen. \u2014", "5. Participate in round-robins", "Having a quick round-robin or something really light to engage everyone at the beginning and at the end of the meeting is usually very honest, and begins and ends the call with a good level of interaction. These simple and fun ideas put no pressure on anyone to perform during Zoom meetings. For instance, ask the team to switch off their cameras and then ask them what another person is wearing. \u2014", "6. Use Zoom's chat feature", "In our meetings, we tend to have little side conversations in the chat feature as the main meeting is going on. Usually, this happens very quickly and consists of jokes, conversations around what people are saying, and questions people have. It's a great way to engage people during Zoom meetings. So, don't shut down any chat conversations during meetings as they can create fun. \u2014", "7. Add a Q&A session", "You can make your next Zoom meeting more engaging by adding a small Q&A session to the end of the event. Use this time to answer your employees' questions and help them with any pressing issues. I've found that this part of the meeting is the most productive and engaging for us because it inspires conversations and helps us brainstorm new ideas. \u2014", "8. Keep meetings on a time limit", "Keeping Zoom meetings to 30 minutes or less is one way to combat Zoom fatigue. Sticking to a strict agenda on the call will help ensure you cover all topics in your meeting. \u2014", "9. Switch up meeting types", "The best way to combat Zoom fatigue is to get off camera. Do this by having different versions of meetings\u2014some that are voice only, some where the camera is optional, and then some meetings where the camera is compulsory. This will take some of the stress away. We save compulsory video calls for all-hands meetings and social events. \u2014", "10. Incorporate tangible exercises", "Striking a balance between on-screen and off-screen time is critical for maintaining energy and combating fatigue, but in this Zoom era, it can be hard to avoid. At your next Zoom meeting, try incorporating activities that rely upon physical worksheets or moments of reflection on physical paper. Doing so keeps the team engaged, without having to spend 100% of the meeting looking at the screen. \u2014"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/", "author_name": "AllBusiness", "author_contrib_type": "Contributor Group", "author_subcontext_header": "Small Business Strategy", "author_about": "", "author_social_links": ["https://www.twitter.com/AllBusiness_com", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/allbusiness.com", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/feed/", "http://www.allbusiness.com"]}},

(Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images)", "What makes a lot more sense is that the money landed in a donor-advised fund (DAF), which behaves like a philanthropic bank account. DAFs are essentially black boxes, since they don\u2019t carry specific requirements like annual distributions or public disclosures of grants tied to a specific donor. Money can sit in DAFs for years without ever going to an operating nonprofit group, which is why ", " does not count such funds when measuring the biggest philanthropists\u2014unless the billionaire shares details about grants actually made by their DAF, as a representative for Musk has done in the past. Of the $280 million that ", "estimates Musk has given to charity over his lifetime (without this latest mega-gift), about 20% has been donated through DAFs.", "One of the advantages of giving stock to a DAF is that Musk receives the tax benefit of the gift\u2014a tax deduction of as much as 30% of his 2021 adjusted gross income\u2014as soon as he makes the donation, even though the shares are sitting in the equivalent of a philanthropic holding tank.\u00a0", "A second scenario is that Musk could have pumped the money into his own foundation instead. In that case, he\u2019d still receive an immediate income tax deduction. But, unlike a gift directly to a DAF, foundations are required to disperse about 5% of assets annually. (If the foundation distributes more than 5% in one year, it can carry forward the excess for five years. If the percentage is not met, the foundation simply pays more in taxes).\u00a0\u00a0", "Up until now, at least, Musk has ranked among the less charitable billionaires in the world, especially relative to the size of his fortune.

Musk gave an additional $1 million to Hack Club this past fall. ", "He\u2019s also given his time to the group. After a few teenage members dug up Musk\u2019s contact information in public records and asked him to speak to the organization in March 2020, Musk agreed and devoted over an hour to a live Q&A video chat the following month\u2014and made his first donation to the organization soon after. \u201cIt allowed us to hugely increase our hiring of engineers to create cool coding games, to one-on-one mentor the teenagers and to support them to build things to code,\u201d says Hack Club\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Christina Asquith.\u00a0", "Musk also donated to a handful of exclusive Los Angeles private schools in 2020, including Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica and The Windward School.

Warren Buffett, far and away the most charitable, has donated about $46.1 billion in his lifetime, or 40% of his $115.6 billion fortune. In 2010, Buffett and Bill Gates cofounded the Giving Pledge\u2014a non-binding oath taken by some of the world\u2019s richest people to donate the majority of their fortunes during their lifetimes or after their deaths.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has given out $2.1 billion to charitable causes, including some $1.3 billion toward climate-focused causes\u2014which equates to about 1% of his estimated $188 billion fortune.\u00a0", "Musk ", " the Giving Pledge in 2012, and the 50-year-old CEO has indicated that he\u2019ll ramp up giving later in life. In 2018, he ", " that he would sell around $100 million worth of Tesla stock \u201cevery few years\u201d for charity and will make \u201cmajor disbursements in about 20 years when Tesla is in a steady state.\u201d Tesla\u2019s stock has soared 1,200% since that tweet, making Musk hundreds of billions of dollars richer on paper.\u00a0", "In time, the recipient(s) of Musk\u2019s $5.7 billion will likely be revealed. But until then,\u00a0it\u2019s best to remember that he gave away the largest amount he\u2019s ever given the same year that he sold the most Tesla stock and exercised the most Tesla options ever. As a result, the reason for the stock gift probably had more to do with lowering his tax bill than anything else. And if Musk\u2019s track record is any indication, the money likely has not made it to those in need quite yet, and may not for a while."]},

Many are waiting to see if President Joe Biden will extend the ongoing student loan repayment pause past the current May 1, 2022 expiration date. As was also the case with his extension of former President Donald Trump\u2019s solar tariffs, there is a strong likelihood that President Biden will extend the student loan repayment pause instituted by Trump two years ago. ", "In fact, the Department of Education recently asked the loan service providers it contracts with to stop notifying borrowers about the resumption of loan repayment in May, which indicates the White House is planning to extend the repayment pause.

If such use of the BDTRP were to become precedent, many expect there would be calls to expand such blanket and unquestioned forgiveness to those who attended traditional, non-profit universities. ", "The November coalition letter to Secretary Cardona explained that \u201cthe notion of the federal government just willy-nilly forgiving billions of dollars in student debt is bad policy. Yet, that is exactly what is happening as the Biden administration is seemingly embracing a policy that forgives student debt if that debt was accrued at a for-profit college, regardless of the quality of education that was provided.\u201d", "As with uncapping the state and local tax deduction, any mass student loan forgiveness program would disproportionately benefit those of above average income and means.

Now a ragtag klezmer band serenades him as photographers snap pictures and boys perform a traditional Hasidic dance in his honor. Across some 400 villages in Russia and the former Soviet republics this scene has been replayed countless times. Leviev is a 47-year-old, Uzbeki-born Israeli citizen and devout Lubavitcher who gives away at least $30 million a year in order to return lost Jews to the flock.", "This little-known billionaire is also the scourge of De Beers, the giant miner and marketer of diamonds, known as the \"Syndicate.\" Leviev was once a sightholder, one of a few exclusive direct buyers of De Beers rough diamonds. Today he is the world's largest cutter and polisher of the precious gems and a primary source of rough stones to other cutters, polishers and jewelry makers around the globe. Those who have watched his rise over the last three decades say it was his intense hatred of De Beers that fueled him. He bristled under the Syndicate's high-handed treatment of buyers, who were given boxes of rough diamonds at take-it-or-leave-it prices and risked being permanently cut off if they balked.", "Leviev won't openly criticize his former South African business partner.

I can remember being beaten regularly by the bullies at school, and I said to myself I would never be afraid of anybody or anything again.\"", "Indeed, he has taken significant business away from De Beers in Russia and Angola\u2014two of the world's largest producers of rough diamonds in terms of value. Leviev has not humbled the once-mighty Syndicate alone. But his defiance has inspired others, like Rio Tinto, owner of Australia's Argyle mine, which bypassed De Beers for the first time in 1996 to sell its 42 million carats directly to polishers in Antwerp. In the early 1990s the Russian government began selling some of its rough supply to others, despite its longtime exclusive deal with De Beers. When miners discovered massive diamond reserves in Canada's Northwest Territories, De Beers had to scramble for a piece. Its share of the rough-diamond market, 80% five years ago, has been cut to 60%.", "The reason Leviev is such a threat is that he has profoundly shaken the tradition-bound diamond business. Until recently De Beers had a virtual chokehold on world supplies, determining who could buy uncut stones\u2014and at what quantities and quality\u2014and where the cutting centers were allowed to prosper. Leviev pulled an end run around the cartel, dealing directly with diamond-producing governments and shattering De Beers' all-important relationship with sightholders. He also became the industry's first diamond dealer with his finger on every facet of production, from mining and cutting to polishing and retailing, capturing profits at every stage.", "Trumping De Beers, Leviev has become very rich. He owns 100% of his diamond business, Lev Leviev Group, and a controlling stake in Africa Israel Investments. The latter is a Yehud, Israel-based conglomerate whose holdings include: commercial real estate in Prague and London; Gottex, a swimwear company; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S.; 173 7-Elevens in New Mexico and Texas; a 33% stake in Cross Israel Highway, that nation's first toll road; and an 85% share of Vash Telecanal, Israel's Russian-language TV channel. Leviev also owns a gold mine in Kazakhstan, pieces of two diamond mines in Angola and mining licenses in the Urals and Namibia. He's probably worth $2 billion.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. ", "A part of that wealth comes from exploiting political connections\u2014which has created enmity and suspicion. A recent example: When Leviev was preparing a bid for 40% of Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the banks supporting him pulled out at the last moment. Sources say it was a lack of transparency in Leviev's business. Even if his hands are clean, Leviev has dealt with people whose mitts are dirty. His ubiquitous brigade of burly armed guards isn't just for show.", "Some of Russia's Jewish establishment resent Leviev's pushing his own brand of Hasidism. He has drawn fire for seeing to it that a Lubavitch rabbi, born in Italy and educated in America, was granted citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Leviev installed him as the country's chief rabbi, though the nation already had one. He's playing with fire, critics say, by aligning himself so closely with Putin. Should the president turn on him, Leviev's Jewish activities could be seen as violating the promise Russia's oligarchs made to Putin to stay out of politics in order to keep their assets\u2014many of which were notoriously acquired in the early 1990s.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. Leviev has also become something of a go-to guy between Israel and central Asian countries, enlisting the secular regimes in those mainly Islamic states in the fight against fundamentalist terror groups. Leviev, who now lives in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Israel, is a close associate of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the presidents of Kazakhstan and his native Uzbekistan. Among his pals in Africa are presidents Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia.", "Leviev grew up in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Though under communism his family was committed to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, and all the males, Leviev included, learned to perform ritual circumcisions in secret. Leviev's father Avner was a successful textile merchant and a collector of rare Persian carpets. After seven years of waiting, the family emigrated to Israel in 1971, having converted their wealth into $1 million in rough diamonds, which they smuggled out of the country. But when they tried to unload them in Israel, they were told the diamonds were of inferior quality, worth only $200,000. Leviev, 15 at the time, vowed to right the wrong. Over his father's objections, he left yeshiva and a life of religious education to take up diamond-cutting.", "He opened his own cutting factory in 1977\u2014when speculation in the burgeoning Israeli diamond market went unchecked. Most cutters held inventory, betting on ever-rising prices. When the market collapsed three years later, banks stopped extending credit and many cutters went bust. Leviev hadn't borrowed against his inventory and was in good enough shape to expand to 12 small factories over the next five years. Scrambling to find enough rough diamonds, he flew frequently to London, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Siberia. He also adapted laser technology and acquired cutting software\u2014a revolutionary innovation at the time\u2014to capture more value from his precious supply. Later his cutters could produce digital 3-D models of various diamond cuts, taking into account imperfections, size, weight and shape before touching the stone. \"Part of his genius,\" says Charles Wyndham, cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants and a former director of De Beers' selling arm, \"was marrying cutting-edge technology to exactly what the market wanted.\"", "Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly. ", "In 1987 De Beers invited Leviev to become a sightholder, a plum position granted to fewer than 150 people. By then he was one of Israel's largest manufacturers of polished stones. Two years later Russia's state-run diamond mining and selling group, now called Alrosa, asked Leviev to help it set up its own cutting factories\u2014the first time any rough diamonds were finished in the country of their origin\u2014in a joint venture called Ruis. (For decades De Beers has been channeling all rough diamonds through its Diamond Trading Co. in London before reselling them to sightholders at a markup; a diamond mined in, say, Africa traveled halfway around the world before it was resold to a sightholder in Africa.) Today, Leviev owns 100% of Ruis, which cuts $140 million worth of diamonds a year, and polishing operations, including one in Perm, Russia, another in Armenia.", "Leviev horned in on the business by cultivating a cozy relationship with Valery Rudakov, who under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran Alrosa. The partnership opened the Kremlin door for Leviev. \"I never spoke about business with Gorbachev,\" Leviev insists. \"I talked to him about opening Jewish schools where there had been none for 70 years.\" But he probably confirmed Rudakov's suspicions (and those of Gorby) that De Beers was lowballing the country on the value of its gems.", "Leviev's deal gave him a piece of Russia's rough-diamond supply, and gave De Beers fits. By 1995 it had had enough of this upstart and booted him from the sightholders' circle. It is widely believed that Leviev, perhaps anticipating the Syndicate's retaliation, had already secured rough supply from Gokhran, Russia's repository of gems, gold, art and antiques, run by Boris Yeltsin pal Yevgeni Bychkov. The Russian government had decided to unload some of the rough and polished stones it had been accumulating for a long time, probably since 1955\u2014a hoard worth as much as $12 billion in the early 1990s, according to Chaim Even-Zohar, publisher in Ramat Gan, Israel of the influential trade journal ", ". It is widely believed that Leviev became a primary means of liquidating the stockpile. What's more, the stockpile contained some of the most precious stones in the world, 100 carats and larger, says Richard Wake-Walker, a cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants. \"The incredible quality we were seeing couldn't come from a year's mining,\" says Barry Berg, vice president of international sales for William Goldberg Diamond, a Manhattan firm that took advantage of the unparalleled deluge. By 1997 a significant portion of that stockpile was gone.", "Was all that liquidation licit? \"That's what state reserves are for,\" says Rudakov, who is now chairman of a Norilsk Nickel unit. \"When a country is in distress it can sell off those reserves.\"", "Clearly, though, there were less legitimate uses. \"There were one or more Kremlin slush funds, and a variety of questionable benefits were distributed,\" says John Helmer, a veteran U.S. business correspondent in Russia. \"Some of the proceeds went to electioneering, some to offshore accounts and some to individual pockets.\" In 1998 Thomas Kneir, then a deputy assistant director at the FBI, testified before a House banking subcommittee about the smuggling of proceeds from the sale of Russia's state assets, including diamonds, into foreign accounts during the loosey-goosey days of early capitalism. Kneir cited the Golden ADA affair, in which rough diamonds worth $170 million were shipped from Russia to a plant it set up in San Francisco, where they were to be cut and polished. But, says Matthew Hart, author of ", ", the gems and cash disappeared along the way, spent on luxury homes and political payoffs. (Bychkov, charged with abuse of power in connection with Golden ADA, was later pardoned by Yeltsin.)", "If he was the conduit for many transactions, Leviev would have raked it in. \"You buy it today, sell it an hour later and get paid tomorrow,\" explains Manhattan buyer Barry Berg. Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly.", "Whatever he was up to during the Yeltsin years, he kept a low profile. Leviev avoided being identified with the \"Family,\" a group of newly hatched tycoons who tried to convert their economic influence into political power. A smart move, because when Putin became president, he marginalized some Family members, like Boris Berezovsky. Leviev had kept close ties with Putin, brokering meetings for the first time between the new Russian president and prominent Israeli politicos.", "While De Beers struggled in the mid-1990s to deal with Leviev in Russia, it had another problem on its hands closer to home: blood diamonds, the ones that paid for knives and guns. Angola, the world's third-largest producer of rough diamonds, was overrun with rebel forces opposed to President Dos Santos. The rebels took control of the diamond territories and flooded the market with up to $1.2 billion in diamonds a year. De Beers had little choice but to buy the stuff or risk losing its grip on prices, according to the London-based group Global Witness.", "Blood diamonds became a PR migraine for De Beers. In 1998 the United Nations slapped sanctions on the buying of Angolan diamonds from the rebels; a widely circulated report by Global Witness singled out De Beers for \"operat[ing] with an extraordinary lack of accountability.\" Under pressure, the Syndicate closed its buying offices in Angola and the war-pocked Democratic Republic of Congo, while continuing to explore in Angola.", "\"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" ", "Leviev had already made a mark in Angola in 1996 when he came through with a $60 million investment, in exchange for 16% of Angola's largest diamond mine, after the government took it back from the rebels. Alrosa, a partner, couldn't come up with the cash. \"Dos Santos said I was the only one who helped his country,\" says Leviev, who guarded his mines with former Israeli intelligence agents. (He and the president bonded, says a report from the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, over their knowledge of Russian and mutual loathing of De Beers.) Leviev also offered to generate more state revenues and promised to cut down on illegal exports. To sweeten the pot, he gave the Angolan government a 51% share of Angola Selling Corp., or Ascorp, the exclusive buyer of Angolan rough diamonds. (Industry insiders whisper that Isabella Dos Santos, the president's daughter, has a separate stake in Ascorp. Leviev says he knows nothing of it.)", "There's more to the story than Leviev cares to discuss. A friend of his, Arcady Gaydamak, an alleged arms dealer with Israeli and Russian citizenship, was an adviser to Dos Santos. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the mid 1990s Gaydamak (wanted in France for illegal arms trafficking) negotiated a forgiveness of Angolan debt to Russia, in exchange for arms. In January 2000, a month after Leviev's Ascorp was awarded the exclusive on Angola's diamonds, Gaydamak bought 15% of Leviev's Africa Israel Investments. Within a year Leviev bought back Gaydamak's stake. A quid pro quo? \"He offered to sell me the shares at a good price,\" says Leviev. \"This was a time before Mr. Gaydamak had legal problems.\" While the two are no longer business associates, they remain chums.", "Leviev apparently delivered on his word to Dos Santos: The government's reported tax collections from diamond sales jumped to $62 million last year from $10 million in 1998. A lot more than that was smuggled out of the country, contends Even-Zohar. Buying up $1 billion worth of Angolan rough diamonds a year strained Leviev, who was under constant pressure to unload the minerals quickly. He couldn't consistently offer miners the best prices. \"So diggers knew they could get far more for their stones, and that led to rampant smuggling,\" says Even-Zohar.", "That may help explain why Leviev lost his Angolan exclusive this summer. When asked about being dropped, Leviev shrugs. \"Don't count me out yet.\"", "He had left a long trail of ill will with De Beers in Angola. In March of 2000 the Syndicate persuaded a Belgian judge to seize a small diamond shipment that turned out to be Leviev's. He successfully petitioned to have the stones returned a few months later. De Beers still contends the 1998 contract with Leviev's Ascorp is invalid and is trying to get its Angolan rights restored and recover $92 million it says it is owed by the Dos Santos government.", "The Syndicate had reason to fight. Ascorp's deal meant that for the first time, De Beers would have had to sell the output of its own mines to someone else\u2014in this case, its archenemy. By May 2001 the company exited Angola entirely.", "Next flashpoint: Namibia, a country rich with diamonds that De Beers has mined since Ernest Oppenheimer bought the concessions after World War I. But like Russia, Namibia wanted to process its own rocks, so in 2000 it forced producers to sell a regular supply of rough diamonds to domestic cutters. De Beers balked, but later relented and built a cutting factory with Namibia\u2014but supplies it with rough from its own London offices.", "Again Leviev exploited the situation. In 2000 he paid $30 million for 37% of Namibian Minerals Corp. (Namco), an offshore diamond mining outfit. As part of the deal, he agreed to open a polishing factory on the Namibian coast. Later, when Namco's mining equipment broke down, Leviev feuded with his partners when they refused to put up more money for repairs. So he got even, forcing the company into bankruptcy, then buying all its mining concessions for a pittance\u2014an estimated $3 million.", "His partnerships in Russia, Angola and Namibia represent part of Leviev's play for direct ownership of rough supplies\u2014geopolitically diversified. He has recently bought a piece of Camafuca in northeast Angola and a diamond exploration licence in Russia's Ural mountains. (Allegedly, he unsuccessfully bid for a piece of Alexkor, South Africa's state-owned diamond mining company. He also failed in an attempt to trade his Namco concessions for a chunk of Trans Hex Group, a publicly traded mining outfit based in Cape Town; one likely stumbling block was his links to Arcady Gaydamak. Leviev denies making either bid.) If Russia's Alrosa, still a state-owned asset, should be privatized, Putin pal Leviev would certainly be on any short list of potential buyers.", "Leviev boasts: \"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" But De Beers has been moving vertically, too. Its loss of market dominance pushed it into the retail end. It formed a joint venture with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, unveiled in 2000, to create an upscale brand that would fetch a premium over unbranded diamonds. Each partner put up $200 million, hoping for the kind of margins that would compensate for the loss of share in the mining side of the business. But so far, all it's done is create collateral damage. In July De Beers dropped 35 of its 120 longtime sightholders (adding 10 new ones), raising rampant speculation that it was keeping its best supplies for its retail operation. De Beers vigorously denies this and says it cut the sightholders following its \"objective [review] process.\" (Still, the move created quite a stir in Manhattan's 47th Street Diamond District; see sidebar above).", "De Beers LV, as the partnership is known, hasn't made the expected splash. So far there's just one stand-alone store, on London's Bond Street. A planned Madison Avenue store has been delayed indefinitely.", "Still, the De Beers-driven branding trend has caught fire. Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with fashion house Escada to create the 12-sided \"Escada cut\" for its signature jewelry line. Leo Schachter Diamonds, a Tel Aviv-based sightholder, spent at least $5 million to advertise its 66-faceted Leo diamond in magazines like ", " and ", ". While Tiffany patented the Lucida diamond, a 50-facet square cut, New York's William Goldberg produced the antique-looking Ashoka variety. Even Leviev is launching his own high-end jewelry line, dubbed the Vivid Collection, hoarding his best stones for pieces priced from $50,000 to a few million dollars.", "Leviev is also moving beyond the ancient game of one-upmanship\u2014and beyond the dirty business of diamonds. You see it in his latest investments. With partners, he's financing $1 billion in real estate development in Russia over the next four years, including three office buildings in central Moscow, and expects to put up a similar amount for office and residential complexes in New York City, Dallas and San Antonio. You can also see it in his political activities. In June he brokered a meeting in Moscow between Putin and American Jewish leaders, including James Tisch, chief executive of Loews Corp., to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.", "Perhaps his religious philanthropy is his ultimate reach for legitimacy. Lately he has expanded his Chabad initiatives, once confined to Russia and other former Soviet republics, to the West. This year he is setting up a school in Dresden to teach nonreligious Jewish emigres about the faith. Last year he opened a new school in Queens, N.Y. that caters to 350 Jewish students whose families formerly lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. \"It's about staying true to the legacy of my father,\" he says. \"All I want is for people in these places to know they are Jewish.\" A moment later he is whisked through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where a caravan of heavily guarded SUVs awaits."]},

DAFs are essentially black boxes, since they don\u2019t carry specific requirements like annual distributions or public disclosures of grants tied to a specific donor. Money can sit in DAFs for years without ever going to an operating nonprofit group, which is why ", " does not count such funds when measuring the biggest philanthropists\u2014unless the billionaire shares details about grants actually made by their DAF, as a representative for Musk has done in the past. Of the $280 million that ", "estimates Musk has given to charity over his lifetime (without this latest mega-gift), about 20% has been donated through DAFs.", "One of the advantages of giving stock to a DAF is that Musk receives the tax benefit of the gift\u2014a tax deduction of as much as 30% of his 2021 adjusted gross income\u2014as soon as he makes the donation, even though the shares are sitting in the equivalent of a philanthropic holding tank.\u00a0", "A second scenario is that Musk could have pumped the money into his own foundation instead. In that case, he\u2019d still receive an immediate income tax deduction. But, unlike a gift directly to a DAF, foundations are required to disperse about 5% of assets annually.

Others become disabled later in life, well after they have already learned to live with non-disabled abilities, expectations, and identities.

Nondisabled people want you to \u201cget over it\u201d and \u201covercome\u201d your disability. Other disabled people want you to project confidence and pride. But especially when disability is an unexpected change in life, some kind of anger and mourning is necessary. Life with a disability can be hard, especially if you are new at it. And it\u2019s only natural to react a bit negatively towards new difficulties you didn\u2019t expect before.", "2. Most people with disabilities eventually decide to embrace their disabilities.", "When you first become disabled, it\u2019s reasonable to work hard at preserving or regaining both your abilities and the sense of self you had before your disability. That\u2019s what rehabilitation and counseling are for. Some people go a step further and choose to mentally and symbolically reject disability itself.", "Some people with disabilities deliberately distance themselves from other disabled people, resist using disability-specific tools like wheelchairs and canes, and refuse to use certain disability terms.

But a lot depends on how you define independence. Understanding that is one of the essential keys to a better life with disabilities.", "4. Adaptive equipment is liberating, not a prison.", "There\u2019s a reason why so many disability activists and cultural critics wish journalists would stop referring to wheelchair users as \u201cwheelchair bound,\u201d or \u201cconfined to a wheelchair.\u201d", "When you can\u2019t walk \u2014 or can\u2019t walk well \u2014 a wheelchair represents freedom and mobility, not captivity and inactivity. The same is true for other adaptive devices and techniques, like canes, walkers, service animals, Braille, large print, Sign Language, and speech devices.", "It often takes some time for newly disabled people to see adaptive devices this way. At first they may look like concrete symbols of recent loss. And when they are especially visible, like wheelchairs, they can feel extra stigmatizing. Newly disabled people put off using wheelchairs or canes because they trigger negative reactions from others. Non-disabled stigmatize these tools because they associate them with disability. The stigma and negativity feed upon themselves. But again, it all depends on your perspective.", "Comparing wheeling to how you used to walk, the wheelchair may seem worse. But comparing wheeling to not being able to move, the wheelchair is much better. Eventually, having the right kind of adaptive equipment in an accessible environment is no longer even a compromise.

Here\u2019s how organizations can make accounting and finance functions more efficient. ", "Optimizing Processes Using Automation ", "Automation is especially critical now because companies want to ensure that workflows are as simple as possible in case employees get sick or leave for other jobs, says William Watts, managing principal of consumer markets at the accounting, consulting and technology firm Crowe.", "In addition, automation helps accounting departments pivot away from repetitive manual tasks, freeing employees up to perform higher-value work. \u201cThat\u2019s something that efficiency-minded chief financial officers are eager to see happen,\u201d Watts explains. \u201cMore companies are eliminating manual or entry-level processing of data in the accounting and reporting areas,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re turning to automation or third-party providers, or they might purchase a cloud-based technology tool that they can bolt on or integrate.\u201d", "\u201cOften, companies already have ", " at their disposal, but they aren\u2019t using them effectively,\u201d says James Hannan, managing director in accounting advisory at Crowe. So companies\u2019 first task is to inventory what they already have. If, for example, the accounting department uses invoicing software, companies should check if the software includes optical character recognition that can scan and process invoices, which could reduce manual processing chores for the accounts payable team. ", "Next, companies need to expand their capabilities, Hannan explains. Rather than requesting document reviews via email, companies could use other available cloud-based applications to securely review that information and simplify their workflows. Cloud accounting platforms can also speed up the account reconciliation process and help eliminate human error.", "Not that technology is a magic bullet. \u201cOrganizations have to figure out where best to use tech and recognize its limitations,\u201d Watts says.

Cloud-based analytics business intelligence tools can \u201cpull information from all the different systems that companies might be using and organize it in an intelligent way,\u201d Hannan adds.", "Integrating cloud-based analytics can yield a more transparent view into operations and become a resource that company leaders and employees alike can mine to make good decisions, such as when to increase inventory or hire more employees.", "\u201cAccountants and finance professionals are used to crunching historical data and producing reports, and now they\u2019re being asked to make decisions and provide input,\u201d Watt says.

This approach allows companies to concentrate on other value-added parts of their strategy, and it\u2019s one that Watts expects organizations to continue to leverage. ", "Today\u2019s cloud-based work technologies can help organizations beat the labor shortage by making it possible to hire new talent from various geographies.

In the early 1990s the Russian government began selling some of its rough supply to others, despite its longtime exclusive deal with De Beers. When miners discovered massive diamond reserves in Canada's Northwest Territories, De Beers had to scramble for a piece. Its share of the rough-diamond market, 80% five years ago, has been cut to 60%.", "The reason Leviev is such a threat is that he has profoundly shaken the tradition-bound diamond business. Until recently De Beers had a virtual chokehold on world supplies, determining who could buy uncut stones\u2014and at what quantities and quality\u2014and where the cutting centers were allowed to prosper. Leviev pulled an end run around the cartel, dealing directly with diamond-producing governments and shattering De Beers' all-important relationship with sightholders. He also became the industry's first diamond dealer with his finger on every facet of production, from mining and cutting to polishing and retailing, capturing profits at every stage.", "Trumping De Beers, Leviev has become very rich. He owns 100% of his diamond business, Lev Leviev Group, and a controlling stake in Africa Israel Investments. The latter is a Yehud, Israel-based conglomerate whose holdings include: commercial real estate in Prague and London; Gottex, a swimwear company; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S.; 173 7-Elevens in New Mexico and Texas; a 33% stake in Cross Israel Highway, that nation's first toll road; and an 85% share of Vash Telecanal, Israel's Russian-language TV channel. Leviev also owns a gold mine in Kazakhstan, pieces of two diamond mines in Angola and mining licenses in the Urals and Namibia. He's probably worth $2 billion.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. ", "A part of that wealth comes from exploiting political connections\u2014which has created enmity and suspicion. A recent example: When Leviev was preparing a bid for 40% of Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the banks supporting him pulled out at the last moment. Sources say it was a lack of transparency in Leviev's business. Even if his hands are clean, Leviev has dealt with people whose mitts are dirty. His ubiquitous brigade of burly armed guards isn't just for show.", "Some of Russia's Jewish establishment resent Leviev's pushing his own brand of Hasidism. He has drawn fire for seeing to it that a Lubavitch rabbi, born in Italy and educated in America, was granted citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Leviev installed him as the country's chief rabbi, though the nation already had one. He's playing with fire, critics say, by aligning himself so closely with Putin. Should the president turn on him, Leviev's Jewish activities could be seen as violating the promise Russia's oligarchs made to Putin to stay out of politics in order to keep their assets\u2014many of which were notoriously acquired in the early 1990s.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. Leviev has also become something of a go-to guy between Israel and central Asian countries, enlisting the secular regimes in those mainly Islamic states in the fight against fundamentalist terror groups. Leviev, who now lives in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Israel, is a close associate of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the presidents of Kazakhstan and his native Uzbekistan. Among his pals in Africa are presidents Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia.", "Leviev grew up in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Though under communism his family was committed to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, and all the males, Leviev included, learned to perform ritual circumcisions in secret. Leviev's father Avner was a successful textile merchant and a collector of rare Persian carpets. After seven years of waiting, the family emigrated to Israel in 1971, having converted their wealth into $1 million in rough diamonds, which they smuggled out of the country. But when they tried to unload them in Israel, they were told the diamonds were of inferior quality, worth only $200,000. Leviev, 15 at the time, vowed to right the wrong. Over his father's objections, he left yeshiva and a life of religious education to take up diamond-cutting.", "He opened his own cutting factory in 1977\u2014when speculation in the burgeoning Israeli diamond market went unchecked. Most cutters held inventory, betting on ever-rising prices. When the market collapsed three years later, banks stopped extending credit and many cutters went bust. Leviev hadn't borrowed against his inventory and was in good enough shape to expand to 12 small factories over the next five years. Scrambling to find enough rough diamonds, he flew frequently to London, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Siberia. He also adapted laser technology and acquired cutting software\u2014a revolutionary innovation at the time\u2014to capture more value from his precious supply. Later his cutters could produce digital 3-D models of various diamond cuts, taking into account imperfections, size, weight and shape before touching the stone. \"Part of his genius,\" says Charles Wyndham, cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants and a former director of De Beers' selling arm, \"was marrying cutting-edge technology to exactly what the market wanted.\"", "Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly. ", "In 1987 De Beers invited Leviev to become a sightholder, a plum position granted to fewer than 150 people. By then he was one of Israel's largest manufacturers of polished stones. Two years later Russia's state-run diamond mining and selling group, now called Alrosa, asked Leviev to help it set up its own cutting factories\u2014the first time any rough diamonds were finished in the country of their origin\u2014in a joint venture called Ruis. (For decades De Beers has been channeling all rough diamonds through its Diamond Trading Co. in London before reselling them to sightholders at a markup; a diamond mined in, say, Africa traveled halfway around the world before it was resold to a sightholder in Africa.) Today, Leviev owns 100% of Ruis, which cuts $140 million worth of diamonds a year, and polishing operations, including one in Perm, Russia, another in Armenia.", "Leviev horned in on the business by cultivating a cozy relationship with Valery Rudakov, who under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran Alrosa. The partnership opened the Kremlin door for Leviev. \"I never spoke about business with Gorbachev,\" Leviev insists. \"I talked to him about opening Jewish schools where there had been none for 70 years.\" But he probably confirmed Rudakov's suspicions (and those of Gorby) that De Beers was lowballing the country on the value of its gems.", "Leviev's deal gave him a piece of Russia's rough-diamond supply, and gave De Beers fits. By 1995 it had had enough of this upstart and booted him from the sightholders' circle. It is widely believed that Leviev, perhaps anticipating the Syndicate's retaliation, had already secured rough supply from Gokhran, Russia's repository of gems, gold, art and antiques, run by Boris Yeltsin pal Yevgeni Bychkov. The Russian government had decided to unload some of the rough and polished stones it had been accumulating for a long time, probably since 1955\u2014a hoard worth as much as $12 billion in the early 1990s, according to Chaim Even-Zohar, publisher in Ramat Gan, Israel of the influential trade journal ", ". It is widely believed that Leviev became a primary means of liquidating the stockpile. What's more, the stockpile contained some of the most precious stones in the world, 100 carats and larger, says Richard Wake-Walker, a cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants. \"The incredible quality we were seeing couldn't come from a year's mining,\" says Barry Berg, vice president of international sales for William Goldberg Diamond, a Manhattan firm that took advantage of the unparalleled deluge. By 1997 a significant portion of that stockpile was gone.", "Was all that liquidation licit? \"That's what state reserves are for,\" says Rudakov, who is now chairman of a Norilsk Nickel unit. \"When a country is in distress it can sell off those reserves.\"", "Clearly, though, there were less legitimate uses. \"There were one or more Kremlin slush funds, and a variety of questionable benefits were distributed,\" says John Helmer, a veteran U.S. business correspondent in Russia. \"Some of the proceeds went to electioneering, some to offshore accounts and some to individual pockets.\" In 1998 Thomas Kneir, then a deputy assistant director at the FBI, testified before a House banking subcommittee about the smuggling of proceeds from the sale of Russia's state assets, including diamonds, into foreign accounts during the loosey-goosey days of early capitalism. Kneir cited the Golden ADA affair, in which rough diamonds worth $170 million were shipped from Russia to a plant it set up in San Francisco, where they were to be cut and polished. But, says Matthew Hart, author of ", ", the gems and cash disappeared along the way, spent on luxury homes and political payoffs. (Bychkov, charged with abuse of power in connection with Golden ADA, was later pardoned by Yeltsin.)", "If he was the conduit for many transactions, Leviev would have raked it in. \"You buy it today, sell it an hour later and get paid tomorrow,\" explains Manhattan buyer Barry Berg. Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly.", "Whatever he was up to during the Yeltsin years, he kept a low profile. Leviev avoided being identified with the \"Family,\" a group of newly hatched tycoons who tried to convert their economic influence into political power. A smart move, because when Putin became president, he marginalized some Family members, like Boris Berezovsky. Leviev had kept close ties with Putin, brokering meetings for the first time between the new Russian president and prominent Israeli politicos.", "While De Beers struggled in the mid-1990s to deal with Leviev in Russia, it had another problem on its hands closer to home: blood diamonds, the ones that paid for knives and guns. Angola, the world's third-largest producer of rough diamonds, was overrun with rebel forces opposed to President Dos Santos. The rebels took control of the diamond territories and flooded the market with up to $1.2 billion in diamonds a year. De Beers had little choice but to buy the stuff or risk losing its grip on prices, according to the London-based group Global Witness.", "Blood diamonds became a PR migraine for De Beers. In 1998 the United Nations slapped sanctions on the buying of Angolan diamonds from the rebels; a widely circulated report by Global Witness singled out De Beers for \"operat[ing] with an extraordinary lack of accountability.\" Under pressure, the Syndicate closed its buying offices in Angola and the war-pocked Democratic Republic of Congo, while continuing to explore in Angola.", "\"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" ", "Leviev had already made a mark in Angola in 1996 when he came through with a $60 million investment, in exchange for 16% of Angola's largest diamond mine, after the government took it back from the rebels. Alrosa, a partner, couldn't come up with the cash. \"Dos Santos said I was the only one who helped his country,\" says Leviev, who guarded his mines with former Israeli intelligence agents. (He and the president bonded, says a report from the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, over their knowledge of Russian and mutual loathing of De Beers.) Leviev also offered to generate more state revenues and promised to cut down on illegal exports. To sweeten the pot, he gave the Angolan government a 51% share of Angola Selling Corp., or Ascorp, the exclusive buyer of Angolan rough diamonds. (Industry insiders whisper that Isabella Dos Santos, the president's daughter, has a separate stake in Ascorp. Leviev says he knows nothing of it.)", "There's more to the story than Leviev cares to discuss. A friend of his, Arcady Gaydamak, an alleged arms dealer with Israeli and Russian citizenship, was an adviser to Dos Santos. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the mid 1990s Gaydamak (wanted in France for illegal arms trafficking) negotiated a forgiveness of Angolan debt to Russia, in exchange for arms. In January 2000, a month after Leviev's Ascorp was awarded the exclusive on Angola's diamonds, Gaydamak bought 15% of Leviev's Africa Israel Investments. Within a year Leviev bought back Gaydamak's stake. A quid pro quo? \"He offered to sell me the shares at a good price,\" says Leviev. \"This was a time before Mr. Gaydamak had legal problems.\" While the two are no longer business associates, they remain chums.", "Leviev apparently delivered on his word to Dos Santos: The government's reported tax collections from diamond sales jumped to $62 million last year from $10 million in 1998. A lot more than that was smuggled out of the country, contends Even-Zohar. Buying up $1 billion worth of Angolan rough diamonds a year strained Leviev, who was under constant pressure to unload the minerals quickly. He couldn't consistently offer miners the best prices. \"So diggers knew they could get far more for their stones, and that led to rampant smuggling,\" says Even-Zohar.", "That may help explain why Leviev lost his Angolan exclusive this summer. When asked about being dropped, Leviev shrugs. \"Don't count me out yet.\"", "He had left a long trail of ill will with De Beers in Angola. In March of 2000 the Syndicate persuaded a Belgian judge to seize a small diamond shipment that turned out to be Leviev's. He successfully petitioned to have the stones returned a few months later. De Beers still contends the 1998 contract with Leviev's Ascorp is invalid and is trying to get its Angolan rights restored and recover $92 million it says it is owed by the Dos Santos government.", "The Syndicate had reason to fight. Ascorp's deal meant that for the first time, De Beers would have had to sell the output of its own mines to someone else\u2014in this case, its archenemy. By May 2001 the company exited Angola entirely.", "Next flashpoint: Namibia, a country rich with diamonds that De Beers has mined since Ernest Oppenheimer bought the concessions after World War I. But like Russia, Namibia wanted to process its own rocks, so in 2000 it forced producers to sell a regular supply of rough diamonds to domestic cutters. De Beers balked, but later relented and built a cutting factory with Namibia\u2014but supplies it with rough from its own London offices.", "Again Leviev exploited the situation. In 2000 he paid $30 million for 37% of Namibian Minerals Corp. (Namco), an offshore diamond mining outfit. As part of the deal, he agreed to open a polishing factory on the Namibian coast. Later, when Namco's mining equipment broke down, Leviev feuded with his partners when they refused to put up more money for repairs. So he got even, forcing the company into bankruptcy, then buying all its mining concessions for a pittance\u2014an estimated $3 million.", "His partnerships in Russia, Angola and Namibia represent part of Leviev's play for direct ownership of rough supplies\u2014geopolitically diversified. He has recently bought a piece of Camafuca in northeast Angola and a diamond exploration licence in Russia's Ural mountains. (Allegedly, he unsuccessfully bid for a piece of Alexkor, South Africa's state-owned diamond mining company. He also failed in an attempt to trade his Namco concessions for a chunk of Trans Hex Group, a publicly traded mining outfit based in Cape Town; one likely stumbling block was his links to Arcady Gaydamak. Leviev denies making either bid.) If Russia's Alrosa, still a state-owned asset, should be privatized, Putin pal Leviev would certainly be on any short list of potential buyers.", "Leviev boasts: \"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" But De Beers has been moving vertically, too. Its loss of market dominance pushed it into the retail end. It formed a joint venture with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, unveiled in 2000, to create an upscale brand that would fetch a premium over unbranded diamonds. Each partner put up $200 million, hoping for the kind of margins that would compensate for the loss of share in the mining side of the business. But so far, all it's done is create collateral damage. In July De Beers dropped 35 of its 120 longtime sightholders (adding 10 new ones), raising rampant speculation that it was keeping its best supplies for its retail operation. De Beers vigorously denies this and says it cut the sightholders following its \"objective [review] process.\" (Still, the move created quite a stir in Manhattan's 47th Street Diamond District; see sidebar above).", "De Beers LV, as the partnership is known, hasn't made the expected splash. So far there's just one stand-alone store, on London's Bond Street. A planned Madison Avenue store has been delayed indefinitely.", "Still, the De Beers-driven branding trend has caught fire. Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with fashion house Escada to create the 12-sided \"Escada cut\" for its signature jewelry line. Leo Schachter Diamonds, a Tel Aviv-based sightholder, spent at least $5 million to advertise its 66-faceted Leo diamond in magazines like ", " and ", ". While Tiffany patented the Lucida diamond, a 50-facet square cut, New York's William Goldberg produced the antique-looking Ashoka variety. Even Leviev is launching his own high-end jewelry line, dubbed the Vivid Collection, hoarding his best stones for pieces priced from $50,000 to a few million dollars.", "Leviev is also moving beyond the ancient game of one-upmanship\u2014and beyond the dirty business of diamonds. You see it in his latest investments. With partners, he's financing $1 billion in real estate development in Russia over the next four years, including three office buildings in central Moscow, and expects to put up a similar amount for office and residential complexes in New York City, Dallas and San Antonio. You can also see it in his political activities. In June he brokered a meeting in Moscow between Putin and American Jewish leaders, including James Tisch, chief executive of Loews Corp., to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.", "Perhaps his religious philanthropy is his ultimate reach for legitimacy. Lately he has expanded his Chabad initiatives, once confined to Russia and other former Soviet republics, to the West. This year he is setting up a school in Dresden to teach nonreligious Jewish emigres about the faith. Last year he opened a new school in Queens, N.Y. that caters to 350 Jewish students whose families formerly lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. \"It's about staying true to the legacy of my father,\" he says. \"All I want is for people in these places to know they are Jewish.\" A moment later he is whisked through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where a caravan of heavily guarded SUVs awaits."], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/", "author_name": "Chase Peterson-Withorn", "author_contrib_type": "Forbes Staff", "author_subcontext_header": "Billionaires", "author_about": "I cover the most successful entrepreneurs doing the biggest deals on the planet.

Nootropics are also hailed as a type of substance that can support cognitive performance. ", "Throughout Chan\u2019s career, she has been open about her experience with anxiety, headaches and sleepless nights due to each stage of professional growth being just as physically and mentally demanding as the next. This led her to invest in her mental well-being and practice self-care rituals, which helped her identify what she needed in order to show up as her best self. Among those non-negotiable habits that set her up for success: quiet time in the morning, for journaling and meditation.", "That\u2019s part of what motivated Chan\u2019s goal of normalizing conversations around mental health and bringing a holistic approach to the wellness industry.

", "When the opportunity arose, Chan was ready to develop the brand alongside Lim, to promote daily self-care in a way that celebrates their heritage. The brand name, No. 8, draws on Chinese culture, as the \u201c8\u201d symbolizes harmony, balance and luck, and the gummies\u2019 flavor profiles are influenced by Asian foods and flavors that its team members grew up eating, including ginger, yuzu,", "lychee, and pear. Chan continues: \u201cAlso, no matter which way you slice the \u20188\u2019, whether it's horizontal or vertical, it's symmetrical. And that was a great way to embody our belief in that mind and body connection.\u201d", "While the nootropic ingredients make it a functional product, No. 8\u2019s branding also takes center stage, as a hero component.", "For Chan, every branding element of No. 8 \u2014 from the elevated packaging and design to the content-rich social media posts \u2014 serves as a mechanism to surprise and delight users, and brings a sense of beauty and excitement to ritual-building. ", "\u201cGood habits help set you up for success. I believe it\u2019s the greatest form of self-love, when you actively make the decision to show up for yourself,\u201d Chan explains.", "To kick off the design process for No. 8, Chan and Lim asked 20 of their friends to show them how they store their supplements.", "\u201cWe had just sent a PSA to our closest friends, asking them to send us a photo of their medicine cabinet,\u201d Chan shares. \u201cWe promised that the photos would not be circulated, would remain anonymous, and that it would purely be for research purposes. Everyone was super open about it, which was the coolest part because we were designing for a new normal.\u201d", "Chan and Lim saw a similar pattern in the way supplements were displayed in their friends\u2019 homes, which helped them identify an opportunity for storing vitamins: No. 8 makes it possible to display supplements in a way that gets users excited to use them, thanks to the intentional branding and premium glass bottles. ", "No. 8 group shot, Photo Credit: Yana Sheptovetskaya", "\u201cThe majority of the images we received were of clear plastic jars that were stashed away in a drawer or a medicine cabinet. When I dug in a little bit deeper, I came to understand that this was actually ", " a highlight in anyone's day,\u201d Chan continues. \u201cThat presented a really big opportunity to me, because we know that if you want to establish a good habit, you need to make that experience enjoyable. And I wanted our products to be something that people would actually enjoy having out on their kitchen counter or on their office desk. The jars are really meant to serve as a vehicle for self-care and a reminder to carve out these moments in your day ", "The \u2018new normal\u2019 that Chan refers to is why it\u2019s so critical for founders of new brands to remain ahead of the eight ball \u2014 and No. 8\u2019s team managed to do this with flying colors. ", "There\u2019s also the halo effect that comes into play.", "\u201cThe halo effect of good branding is that it spurs conversation and has an opportunity to become a multiplier. So if something catches your eye on someone\u2019s work desk or Instagram feed, chances are you\u2019re probably going to take a photo of it, Google it or ask someone about it. The glass jars are meant to encourage people to share openly about their wellness practice and also learn about brain health and mental health, which is the core of what we're doing.\u201d", "Chan learned about the magic of strong design and branding as a vehicle for conversation thanks to her previous role as a founding member of the Museum of Ice Cream. She had also worked on Sephora\u2019s merchandising and product buying team prior to MOIC.", "\u201cMy time at Museum of Ice Cream is really where I learned the power of brand identity and the importance of utilizing these various mediums to reinforce it. So whether it's the green box the jars come in, or the rich printed brochure that explains the ingredients, or even the visual identity of our social media content, everything that we put forward complements the sensibility of the brand.\u201d", "Chan partnered with award-winning female-led agency Utendahl Creative to design and develop No. 8\u2019s branding. ", "Standing out and being set apart from other brands was paramount to cofounders Chan and Lim. ", "You can say Chan\u2019s background at Museum of Ice Cream helped inspire another fun part of the R&D process: when Chan and Lim were gathering photos from friends and were deep in the product development phase, they referred to their top secret mission as \u2018confectionary apothecary\u2019 \u2014 referencing the candy-like nature of the nootropic gummies, as well as their value as a self-care item. ", "\u201cAs we were starting to approach this category, one of the main concerns we had and that we were hearing from everyone is that they had pill fatigue \u2014 people were taking 10 to 12 tablets or capsules a day. That reinforced our choice to approach the gummy category, which is approachable and fun.\u201d", "Chan had known Lim, who is a mentor to Chan, for a while \u2014 they met in Singapore where they are both originally from. ", "\u201cHe came to me with the idea, which led me down the rabbit hole of analyzing and experimenting with nootropics,\u201d Chan shares. \u201cWe began brainstorming all the different ways we could approach this category differently. That led to a cold outreach to Dr. Bowen Jiang and Professor Dr. Octavio Choi, the two Stanford neuroscientists on our Medical Council who have been with us since day one, from formulating all the way through to content development on mental health on brain health.\u201d", "All the ingredients and dosages are based on scientific research and medical journals, vetted Dr. Jiang and Dr. Choi.", "\u201cOur formulations are naturally-derived nootropics and the ingredients are commonly found in Ayurvedic or traditional Chinese medicine.\u201d", "Every detail in the creation of No. 8 was intentional and by design \u2014 literally. ", "\u201cWhen people see the glass jars the gummies come in, they could be anything. We\u2019ve had people ask whether they contain a candle or tea. This means I've done my job here \u2014 I\u2019ve ensured that they\u2019re eye catching enough that people are curious to ask about them.\u201d", "To create loyalty, No. 8 also launched a subscription model (each flavor jar contains a one-month supply of 120 gummies) and released samplers and minis, for the more \u2018nootropic-curious.\u2019 Sustainability is also a brand pillar, and subscription orders come in compostable refill bags after the first month. The durable glass jars also offer a reusability factor, for storing an assortment of items. ", "As a player in a \u2018new normal\u2019 of the supplements category, No. 8 strives to emphasize how the nooptropic gummies can be incorporated into one\u2019s daily routines. \u201cIt\u2019s about being aware of the more holistic approaches we can incorporate into our routines to help make sure we're showing up in our best light and showing up as our best selves.\u201d", "The holistic aspect of the company is what inspires its content-rich social media posts, based on the overarching themes and notions of maintaining a positive mindset, doing away with limiting beliefs, and knowing to control what you can actually control.

It holds you accountable to setting affirmations,\u201d Chan shares. \u201cThe hope is that at the end of the month, you're in a very different place and headspace \u2014 both physically and mentally.\u201d", "The prompt at the end of the 30 day-tracker is meant to look back on growth.

That in turn had numerous effects on the legal status of disabled people, the development and direction of disability services, and the shape and tone of disability communities and advocacy.", "Wars and new diseases create new disabled people. But even without landmark events like Covid, disability is and always has been a possibility for just about everyone. As so many disabled people keep saying in a dozen different ways, the disability community is the one \u201cminority group\u201d literally anyone can join. It\u2019s almost inevitable. Millions of people who aren\u2019t disabled now will one day acquire at least some kind of disability, if not from illness or accident, then from the otherwise good fortune of living to an old age.", "This also points out one of the main differences among disabled people. Some are born, grow up, and shape their lives and personalities ", " their disabilities. Others become disabled later in life, well after they have already learned to live with non-disabled abilities, expectations, and identities. Each kind of disability \u201corigin story\u201d has both similarities and differences, challenges and compensations. All disabled people face practical and emotional barriers. But becoming disabled later in life usually involves distinctive experiences and struggles that lifelong disabled people don\u2019t go through in quite the same way.", "With another historic spike in disability a real possibility, now is a good time to focus on how people experience \u201cnew\u201d disabilities.

But there are some facts and ideas that can be useful to just about anyone who acquires a disability.", "1. It\u2019s okay to be upset.", "It\u2019s natural and even healthy to be sad and angry about becoming disabled.", "Sometimes there are very specific reasons to be angry, like being the victim of a drunk driver or an act violence \u2014 or affected by a mishandled and politicized pandemic. Often there is nothing and nobody in particular to blame.

And grief and anger ", " certainly become an additional barrier and a drag, if it goes on too long or overwhelms all other feelings and motivations.", "At the same time, disabled people should resist the subtle but often strong pressure to curb negative feelings. Nondisabled people want you to \u201cget over it\u201d and \u201covercome\u201d your disability. Other disabled people want you to project confidence and pride. But especially when disability is an unexpected change in life, some kind of anger and mourning is necessary. Life with a disability can be hard, especially if you are new at it. And it\u2019s only natural to react a bit negatively towards new difficulties you didn\u2019t expect before.", "2. Most people with disabilities eventually decide to embrace their disabilities.", "When you first become disabled, it\u2019s reasonable to work hard at preserving or regaining both your abilities and the sense of self you had before your disability. That\u2019s what rehabilitation and counseling are for. Some people go a step further and choose to mentally and symbolically reject disability itself.", "Some people with disabilities deliberately distance themselves from other disabled people, resist using disability-specific tools like wheelchairs and canes, and refuse to use certain disability terms. There is a perception that if you refuse to see yourself or project yourself as disabled, you won\u2019t be.", "That\u2019s a very difficult approach to maintain over time. You do have disabilities, and it becomes increasingly bizarre to act as if you don\u2019t. And most disabled people find that they lose more than they gain when they hold other disabled people at a distance and don\u2019t incorporate disability into their identities.", "Embracing or \u201cowning\u201d your disability doesn\u2019t mean you always like it. Nor does it mean \u201cletting disability define you.\u201d It just means making disability a part of who you are \u2014 and perhaps allowing yourself to benefit from the community and fellowship of fellow disabled people.", "3. You don\u2019t have to do everything for yourself, by yourself to be independent.", "When you first become disabled, you want to be able to do things for yourself again, as you did before.

She is often quoted as saying, \u201cIndependent Living is not doing things by yourself, it is being in control of how things are done.\u201d This simple statement is revolutionary. You can be independent, even if you need help to get out of bed, bathe and dress, cook and feed yourself, or go to the bathroom. The key having the support services you need for those things, and the authority to direct help and make your own life decisions.", "Losing independence is one of the biggest fears non-disabled people have about disability. But a lot depends on how you define independence. Understanding that is one of the essential keys to a better life with disabilities.", "4. Adaptive equipment is liberating, not a prison.", "There\u2019s a reason why so many disability activists and cultural critics wish journalists would stop referring to wheelchair users as \u201cwheelchair bound,\u201d or \u201cconfined to a wheelchair.\u201d", "When you can\u2019t walk \u2014 or can\u2019t walk well \u2014 a wheelchair represents freedom and mobility, not captivity and inactivity. The same is true for other adaptive devices and techniques, like canes, walkers, service animals, Braille, large print, Sign Language, and speech devices.", "It often takes some time for newly disabled people to see adaptive devices this way. At first they may look like concrete symbols of recent loss. And when they are especially visible, like wheelchairs, they can feel extra stigmatizing. Newly disabled people put off using wheelchairs or canes because they trigger negative reactions from others. Non-disabled stigmatize these tools because they associate them with disability. The stigma and negativity feed upon themselves. But again, it all depends on your perspective.", "Comparing wheeling to how you used to walk, the wheelchair may seem worse. But comparing wheeling to not being able to move, the wheelchair is much better. Eventually, having the right kind of adaptive equipment in an accessible environment is no longer even a compromise. In most ways it is as good as your previous abilities. The key is to value adaptive devices for what they do, not how you think they might be perceived.", "5. Living well with a disability requires a balanced approach.", "The classic model of success for people with disabilities \u2014 both material and emotional \u2014 hinges on self-reliance. This means focusing on yourself, improving yourself, confronting your own problems head-on.", "From this perspective, advocacy and activism are sometimes portrayed as a diversion from self-improvement, as a way to externalize frustrations.

They seem to be obsessed with ", ", while other disabled people emphasize the ", ", which is presumed to be more healthy.", "But most happy and successful disabled people do both. They take care of themselves and always strive for self-improvement \u2014 ", " they work with other disabled people to improve conditions for all disabled people. They work to make their own lives better, and for disability rights and justice. They also balance optimism with realism, appreciating what\u2019s good, while not shying away from pointing out fixing what\u2019s bad.", "6. There is a lot happening in the world of disability.", "When you are new to disability, it can feel like you are the only one going through difficulties. Many newly disabled people feel abandoned and alone. They get the impression that aside from doctors and therapists, the field of disability is empty. It seems like nobody is ", "Disability culture and activism ", " somewhat hidden and fragmented. And they are especially invisible to non-disabled people. That makes it harder for newly disabled people to find \u201ctheir people\u201d than it is for other marginalized communities. ", "But disabled people are everywhere. Disability culture is rich and vibrant. Disability activism is sophisticated and active. Before you assume that nothing is happening and nobody is doing anything on a disability issue, take the time to look around and find out. Chances are good that people are actually working on your issue and want to hear from you.", "Here are a few places to start your search for the kind of disability services and activity you might be looking for:", "7. There is no right or wrong way to deal with your disability.", "Above all, remember that too much of any single approach can be hard to sustain and somewhat limiting. A balance of approaches and focus is usually more healthy and productive.", "And don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you are \u201cdoing disability wrong.\u201d Whatever you do, on whatever strategy or timeline works best for you, don\u2019t worry about your take on disability being right, or satisfying anyone else.

For example, a trained neurosurgeon who can no longer perform surgery due to a disability, but can still practice as a neurologist or as a professor in a medical school, can receive benefits from this type of policy because they can\u2019t continue to perform the job for which they were trained. In that example a regular disability policy wouldn\u2019t kick in since the doctor was still capable of working.

In fact, the top request I receive from physicians is to help them find a more suitable life insurance policy so they can drop the older one that was not appropriate for their needs.", "For physicians right out of training, it\u2019s common to have a mountain of debt and a young family. Maintaining a suitable cash flow to pay all their expenses may be challenging. In such a scenario, term life insurance tends to be the best solution. If you are young and healthy, you can obtain a high level of term life insurance coverage for an affordable price. Policies can cover the insured for three decades or more. Plus, the premiums can remain level over the life of the policy, which is helpful from a cash flow perspective.

Even with no company match, the ability to max out a 401(k) retirement account will be immensely beneficial. In 2022, the maximum amount that someone under the age of 50 can contribute is $20,500. If a physician contributes that max amount every year of a 40 year career, and the account grows at a 6% rate, they will have over $3.3 million dollars in savings upon retirement.

A few good books or reading some decent articles can provide you with the essentials to make good decisions.", " Given many doctors\u2019 busy schedules, it oftentimes behooves them to engage a professional for help. The challenge is finding a financial advisor that is a true fiduciary and knowledgeable in the field. A helpful exercise will be to ask the advisor to spend a few hours educating you about the basics in financial planning. A fiduciary will gladly take the time to do this because it is part of their process, while those folks looking to make a quick sale will not. This exercise will make it obvious the preferred advisor with whom to engage.", "There is a myriad of advanced planning strategies that may be beneficial to doctors. These include backdoor Roth IRA contributions, Roth conversions, asset location strategies, maxing out an HSA account, gifting techniques, philanthropic planning, estate tax minimization strategies, and many more.

At the same time, a variety of security and structural concerns were being raised about The DAO, including one that would, ironically, later prove to be crucial to limiting the hacker\u2019s immediate access to the spoils. That problem: withdrawing funds was too hard. Someone wanting to retrieve their money had to first create a \u201cchild DAO\u201d or \u201csplit DAO,\u201d which required not only a high degree of technical knowledge, but also waiting periods after each step and the agreement of anyone else who moved funds into that child DAO.", "On the morning of June 17th, ETH reached a new all-time high of $21.52, making the crypto in The DAO worth $249.6 million.

", "Soon, the Ethereum community pinpointed the vulnerability that enabled this theft: the DAO smart contract had been written so that any time someone withdrew money, the smart contract would send the money first, before updating that person\u2019s balance. The attacker had used a malicious smart contract that withdrew money (258 ETH at a time), then interfered with the updating of the contract, allowing them to withdraw the same ether again and again.

The third showed how an attacker could do this cheaply.", "To put the enormity of this hack in perspective, with ETH now trading around $3,000, 3.64 million ETH would be worth $11 billion.

The morning after the attack, at 7:18 A.M. Singapore time, Hoenisch trolled Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin by retweeting something Buterin had said before The DAO was attacked, but after it was known that the vulnerability used in the attack was evident in the DAO\u2019s code. In the two-week old tweet, Buterin had said that he\u2019d been buying DAO tokens since the security news. Over the following weeks, Hoenisch tweeted anti-hard fork posts like one titled, \u201cToo Big to Fail is Failure Guaranteed.\u201d ", "Curiously, on July 5, a couple weeks after the attack, Hoenisch and Karapetsas exchanged Reddit DMs titled \u201cDarkDAO counter attack\u201d \u2014 though the substance of the messages is unclear because Hoensich has deleted all his Reddit posts. (Hosp recalls that Hoenisch told him he had deleted his Reddit account after an altercation with an \u201cidiot\u201d on Reddit over The DAO.) Hoenisch wrote, \u201cSorry for not contacting first. I got carried away from finding it and telling the community that there is a way to fight back. In any case, I don't see any way the attacker can use this.\u201d", "After Karapetsas told Hoenisch of the white hats\u2019 plans to protect what was left in The DAO, Hoenisch replied, \u201cI took down the post.\u201d Karapetsas responded, \u201cI will keep you up to date with what we do from now on.\u201d Hoenisch\u2019s last message in that exchange: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I messed up the plan.\u201d", "On July 24th, the day after the Ethereum Classic chain revived and began trading on Poloniex, Hoenisch tweeted, \u201cethereum drama escalating: from #daowars to #chainwars. Ethereum classic now traded on poloniex as $ETC and miners planning attacks.\u201d On July 26th, he retweeted Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of the powerful and well-respected Digital Currency Group, who had tweeted, \u201cBought my first non-bitcoin digital currency\u2026Ethereum Classic (ETC).\u201d", "\u201cHe (the DAO hacker) really screwed the pooch. Reputation is way more valuable than money.\u201d ", "Upon hearing the name Toby Hoenisch, without knowing evidence indicated he was the DAO attacker, Karapetsas, a usually good-humored Greek software developer who was one of the DAO creators and had engaged with him by email and on Reddit, said: \u201cHe was obnoxious\u2026. he was quite insistent on having found a lot of problems.\u201d After hearing that the DarkDAO ETC had been cashed out to a Grin node with Hoenisch\u2019s alias, Karapetsas observed that if Hoenisch had instead remedied the situation while the DarkDao funds were frozen, the Ethereum community would have given him \u201chuge kudos'' for finding the weakness and then returning the ETH. Similarly, Griff Green, whose current projects lean towards helping non-profit and public causes grow in the digital world, believes the hacker missed the chance to \u201cbe a hero.\u201d Says Green: \u201cHe really screwed the pooch...Reputation is way more valuable than money.\u201d", "Ironically, in a 2016 blog post, Hoenisch wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a white hat hacker by heart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0Twenty days later came the DAO attack.", "As I noted earlier,\u00a0after being sent a document laying out the evidence that he was the hacker and asking for comment for my book, Hoenisch wrote that my conclusion is \u201cfactually inaccurate.\u201d He said in that email he could give me more details\u2014and then did not respond to four requests for those details, nor to additional fact checking queries for this article.\u00a0In addition, after receiving the first document detailing the facts I\u2019d gathered, he deleted almost all his Twitter history (though I\u2019ve saved the relevant tweets).

The market cap of TenX tokens, which spiked at $535 million, now sits at just $11 million. TenX has rebranded itself as Mimo Capital and is offering holders of TenX tokens mostly worthless MIMO tokens instead at a rate of 0.37 MIMO for each TenX.", "Hosp, who was the public face of the company while there, was booted by Hoenisch and another cofounder in January 2019. This occurred a couple months after some crypto publications reported on Hosp\u2019s past affiliation with an Austrian multi-level marketing scheme. However, before hearing that evidence indicated Hoenisch was the DAO attacker, Hosp said his feeling had been that Hoenisch had perhaps pushed him out over jealousy that Hosp had sold bitcoin at the top of the bubble in late 2017, netting himself $20 million. Meanwhile, Hoenisch had kept all his crypto as the bubble \u2013 and his personal net worth \u2013 deflated. ", "\u201cHe came from a very poor family, he had no experience in investing, and he was in crypto in 2010 but he had literally no money, nothing, when we were in Las Vegas together [in the summer of 2016] he had nothing, and I was doing really well with my investments\u2026 he would always push for getting more salary, for having something nicer.\u201d Hosp also mentioned Hoenisch had to send money home to his mother, who had raised him, as well as his sister and brother, as a single parent.", "As new blockchain applications arise, one of the first uses of crypto\u2014as an anonymity shield\u2014is in retreat. ", "Upon hearing that Hoenisch was the likely DAO attacker, Hosp said he was \u201cgetting goose bumps\u201d and begin recalling details from his interactions with his former partner that now seemed to take on new significance.\u00a0For example, when asked if Hoenisch was into Grin (the privacy coins to which the hacker had cashed out) Hosp said, \u201cYes! Yes, he was. He was fascinated by that\u2026I lost money because of those stupid coins! I invested in them because of him, because he was so fascinated by them.\u201d He said that Hoenisch was also obsessed with building a Bitcoin/Monero \u201catomic swap\u201d \u2013 or a way to use smart contracts to swap between Bitcoin and the privacy coin Monero. At the time, Hosp was confused by that, because he felt there was no market for such a product. Later, Hosp pulled up chats from August 2016, in which Hoenisch seemed excited about the price of ETC, the coin held by the hacker after the ethereum fork. ", "When trying to recall the incident that he believed prompted Hoenisch to close his Reddit, Hosp began searching on his computer and muttered to himself, \u201cHe always used tobyai.\u201d He confirmed that one of Toby\u2019s regular email addresses ended in @toby.ai. ", "Recalled a still astounded Hosp: \u201cFor some weird reason, he was quite well aware of what was happening\u2026He understood more of the DAO hack when I asked him what had happened\u2026than I had found on the internet or anywhere.\u201d"]},

", "Due to their high income, financial planning needs, and lack of financial education right out of medical school, many doctors may be an easy target for unscrupulous salespeople looking to make a quick buck. Some physicians were pressured into making imprudent decisions regarding their personal finances and, consequently, have gotten burned and need to dig themselves out of a financial hole. That is often the reason that doctors ask a lot of questions at the start of a new financial planning relationship and may be hesitant before engaging with a financial advisor. ", "Fortunately, understanding a few simple principles can improve the financial trajectory for many in the medical field. Below is a short checklist that may help newly minted physicians make informed decisions regarding their money and, importantly, help avoid the major mistakes that have been financially devastating for many of their colleagues.", "1) ", "The medical field is one of the few professions where it may actually pay off to take out a large level of debt for education. Typically, doctors are highly compensated and will earn enough to, with proper planning, pay down a high level of debt within a few years. The key is keeping expenses low until the loans are paid in full. ", "Practically, this can mean deciding to continue to live like a student, even when you\u2019re getting paid a high income, until you\u2019ve paid off your loans. Many are accustomed to living modestly while in medical school, residency, and during fellowships. Maintaining that lifestyle for a few more years can make a huge difference to your financial future. Trying to change your lifestyle to reduce expenses after you\u2019ve bought a nice house, luxury car, or have been on fancy vacations will be a lot more difficult.

Making some sacrifices while you are young could be the best way to get there.", "2) ", " Disability insurance helps replace a portion of one\u2019s income if they can't perform their job. If someone were unable to work due to illness or injury, a disability policy can help pay for their expenses. ", "While disability insurance is important for everybody, it\u2019s especially important for physicians who spent years, and lots of money, training to attain their current position. Being unable to continue earning their salary can be financially devastating to them and their loved ones. ", "More specifically, doctors should get a true own-occupation disability policy. With this coverage, if a doctor becomes disabled they will receive the full policy benefits if they can\u2019t perform the specific duties of their specialty. For example, a trained neurosurgeon who can no longer perform surgery due to a disability, but can still practice as a neurologist or as a professor in a medical school, can receive benefits from this type of policy because they can\u2019t continue to perform the job for which they were trained. In that example a regular disability policy wouldn\u2019t kick in since the doctor was still capable of working. ", "It would be a shame to spend years training for a certain specialty only to get disabled and not be able to earn the income of your chosen profession. A proper disability policy can help protect against that risk.", ": There are many insurance companies that offer disability insurance. It makes sense to take the time to evaluate multiple options to find the best policy, from a highly rated insurer, to meet your needs.", "3) ", "After graduating medical school, one of the first financial products that many physicians purchase is life insurance. This is a reasonable decision if the doctor has family members depending on their income for financial stability or they anticipate starting a family in the near-term. What is not always reasonable is the type of life insurance the physician is sold. In fact, the top request I receive from physicians is to help them find a more suitable life insurance policy so they can drop the older one that was not appropriate for their needs.", "For physicians right out of training, it\u2019s common to have a mountain of debt and a young family. Maintaining a suitable cash flow to pay all their expenses may be challenging. In such a scenario, term life insurance tends to be the best solution. If you are young and healthy, you can obtain a high level of term life insurance coverage for an affordable price. Policies can cover the insured for three decades or more. Plus, the premiums can remain level over the life of the policy, which is helpful from a cash flow perspective. ", " Permanent life insurance is a fine solution for those with estate planning, legacy, or tax considerations. Revisiting your policy over the years to determine if term is still the optimal solution for you is advisable. However, jumping into purchasing a permanent policy when you have limited financial resources and a tight budget is ill-advised. ", "4) ", " Doctors typically fit the financial profile for many alternative investment professionals looking to raise funds for their latest deal. While these \u201copportunities\u201d sound exotic and project high possible returns, they are often illiquid, non-transparent, and are unnecessary to reach your goals. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these vehicles will offer performance that will outpace boring stock index funds.", " The best way to steer clear of costly financial errors is to stick to simple and boring investments.", "5) ", "One of the most powerful methods of ensuring your financial future is simply taking advantage of your employer\u2019s corporate retirement account. Even with no company match, the ability to max out a 401(k) retirement account will be immensely beneficial. In 2022, the maximum amount that someone under the age of 50 can contribute is $20,500. If a physician contributes that max amount every year of a 40 year career, and the account grows at a 6% rate, they will have over $3.3 million dollars in savings upon retirement. This is a conservative assumption since many organizations offer some form of profit-sharing plan to employees which allows for an even larger annual contribution.", "There is no need to do anything fancy to build a substantial nest egg. Simply saving regularly in a tax efficient account and prudently managing your funds may be all that is necessary to achieve your long-term goals.", "6) ", " One of the most important steps a young physician can take to position themselves for financial success is to become educated about personal finance. Granted, between a grueling work schedule and busy personal life, there\u2019s not much time for recreational reading. The good news is that understanding the building blocks of financial and investment planning is not like studying neurosurgery. A few good books or reading some decent articles can provide you with the essentials to make good decisions.", " Given many doctors\u2019 busy schedules, it oftentimes behooves them to engage a professional for help. The challenge is finding a financial advisor that is a true fiduciary and knowledgeable in the field. A helpful exercise will be to ask the advisor to spend a few hours educating you about the basics in financial planning. A fiduciary will gladly take the time to do this because it is part of their process, while those folks looking to make a quick sale will not. This exercise will make it obvious the preferred advisor with whom to engage.", "There is a myriad of advanced planning strategies that may be beneficial to doctors. These include backdoor Roth IRA contributions, Roth conversions, asset location strategies, maxing out an HSA account, gifting techniques, philanthropic planning, estate tax minimization strategies, and many more.

Except last July, one of my sources involved in the DAO rescue, a Brazilian named Alex Van de Sande (aka Avsa) reached out, saying the Brazilian Police had opened an investigation into the attack on The DAO \u2014 and whether he might be a victim or even the hacker himself.\u00a0 Van de Sande decided to commission a forensics report from blockchain analytics company Coinfirm to help exonerate himself (though then, the police closed the investigation, he said). In case any similar situations arose in the future, he went forward with the report examining those cash-out attempts in 2016.", "Among the early suspects\u00a0in the hack had been a Swiss businessman and his associates, and in tracing the funds, Van de Sande and I also found another suspect: a Russia-based Ethereum Classic developer. But all these people were in Europe/Russia and the cash-outs mapped onto an Asian-morning-through-evening schedule\u2014from 9 A.M. to midnight Tokyo time\u2014when the Europeans were likely sleeping. (The timing of their social media posts suggested they kept fairly normal hours.)\u00a0But based on a customer support email the hacker had submitted to ShapeShift in the leadup to the attack, I believed they spoke fluent English.", "Jumping off from the Coinfirm analysis, blockchain analytics company Chainalysis saw the presumed attacker had sent 50 BTC to a Wasabi Wallet, a private desktop Bitcoin wallet that aims to anonymize transactions by mixing several together", "in a so-called CoinJoin. Using a capability that is being disclosed here for the first time, Chainalysis de-mixed the Wasabi transactions and tracked their output to four exchanges. In a final, crucial step, an employee at one of the exchanges confirmed to one of my sources that the funds were swapped for privacy coin Grin and withdrawn to a Grin node called grin.toby.ai. (Due to exchange privacy policies,\u00a0normally this sort of customer information would not be disclosed.)", "The IP address for that node also hosted Bitcoin Lightning nodes: ln.toby.ai, lnd.ln.toby.ai, etc., and was consistent for over a year; it was not a VPN.", "It was hosted on Amazon Singapore.\u00a0Lightning explorer 1ML showed a node at that IP called TenX.", "For anyone who was into crypto in June 2017, this name may ring a bell. That month, as the ICO craze was reaching its initial peak, there was an $80 million ICO named TenX. The CEO and cofounder used the handle @tobyai on AngelList, Betalist, GitHub, Keybase, LinkedIn, Medium, Pinterest, Reddit,", "StackOverflow, and Twitter. His name was Toby Hoenisch.", "Where was he based? In Singapore.", "Although he was German-born and raised in Austria, Hoenisch is fluent in English.", "The cash-out transactions occurred mainly from 8 A.M. until 11 P.M. Singapore time.", "And the email address used on that account at the exchange was [name of exchange]@toby.ai.", "In May 2016, as it was finishing up its historic fundraise, Hoenisch was intensely interested in The DAO. On May 12, he emailed Hosp a tip (\u201cProfitable crypto trade coming up\u201d) to short ETH once the DAO crowdfunding period ended. On May 17th and 18", ", in the DAO Slack channel, he engaged in a long conversation in which he made, depending on how you count, 52 comments, minimum, about vulnerabilities in The DAO, getting into various aspects of the code and nitpicking over exactly what was possible given the way the code was structured.", "One issue spurred him to email Slock.it\u2019s chief technology officer, Christoph Jentzsch, its lead technical engineer, Lefteris Karapetsas, and community manager Griff Green. In his email, he said he was writing a proposal for funding from The DAO for a crypto card product called DAO.PAY, and added, \u201cFor our due diligence, we went through the DAO code and found a few things that are worrisome.\u201d He outlined three possible attack vectors and later emailed with a fourth. Jentzsch, a German who had been working on a PhD in physics before dropping out to focus on Ethereum, responded point by point, conceding some of Hoenisch\u2019s assertions but saying others were \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t work.\u201d\u00a0The back and forth ended with Hoenisch writing;\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll keep you in the loop if we find anything else.\u201d", "But instead of further email exchanges, on May 28", ", Hoenish wrote four posts on Medium, beginning with, \u201cTheDAO\u2014risk free voting.\u201d The second, \u201cTheDAO\u2014blackmailing withdrawals,\u201d foreshadowed the main issue with The DAO and why Ethereum ultimately chose to hard fork: if it did not, the only other options were to let the attacker cash out his ill-gotten gains or for some group of DAO token holders to follow him forever into new split DAOs he created as he attempted to cash out. \u201cTLDR: If you end upon in a DAO contract without majority voting power, then an attacker can block all withdrawals indefinitely,\u201d he wrote. The third showed how an attacker could do this cheaply.", "To put the enormity of this hack in perspective, with ETH now trading around $3,000, 3.64 million ETH would be worth $11 billion. ", "His last, most telling post for the day, \u201cTheDAO\u2014a $150m lesson in decentralized governance,\u201d said DAO.PAY decided against making a proposal after uncovering \u201cmajor security flaws\u201d and that \u201cSlockit down-played the severity of the attack vectors.\u201d He wrote, \u201cTheDAO is live \u2026 and we are still waiting for Slockit to put out a warning that THERE IS NO SAFE WAY TO WITHDRAW!\u201d", "On June 3, his last Medium post, \u201cAnnouncing BlockOps: Blockchain Hack Challenges\u201d said, \u201cBlockOps is your playground to break encryption, steal bitcoin, break smart contracts and simply test your security knowledge.\u201d Although he promised to \u201cpost new challenges in the field of bitcoin, ethereum and web security every 2 weeks,\u201d I could find no record that he did so.", "Two weeks later came the DAO attack. The morning after the attack, at 7:18 A.M. Singapore time, Hoenisch trolled Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin by retweeting something Buterin had said before The DAO was attacked, but after it was known that the vulnerability used in the attack was evident in the DAO\u2019s code. In the two-week old tweet, Buterin had said that he\u2019d been buying DAO tokens since the security news. Over the following weeks, Hoenisch tweeted anti-hard fork posts like one titled, \u201cToo Big to Fail is Failure Guaranteed.\u201d ", "Curiously, on July 5, a couple weeks after the attack, Hoenisch and Karapetsas exchanged Reddit DMs titled \u201cDarkDAO counter attack\u201d \u2014 though the substance of the messages is unclear because Hoensich has deleted all his Reddit posts. (Hosp recalls that Hoenisch told him he had deleted his Reddit account after an altercation with an \u201cidiot\u201d on Reddit over The DAO.) Hoenisch wrote, \u201cSorry for not contacting first. I got carried away from finding it and telling the community that there is a way to fight back. In any case, I don't see any way the attacker can use this.\u201d", "After Karapetsas told Hoenisch of the white hats\u2019 plans to protect what was left in The DAO, Hoenisch replied, \u201cI took down the post.\u201d Karapetsas responded, \u201cI will keep you up to date with what we do from now on.\u201d Hoenisch\u2019s last message in that exchange: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I messed up the plan.\u201d", "On July 24th, the day after the Ethereum Classic chain revived and began trading on Poloniex, Hoenisch tweeted, \u201cethereum drama escalating: from #daowars to #chainwars. Ethereum classic now traded on poloniex as $ETC and miners planning attacks.\u201d On July 26th, he retweeted Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of the powerful and well-respected Digital Currency Group, who had tweeted, \u201cBought my first non-bitcoin digital currency\u2026Ethereum Classic (ETC).\u201d", "\u201cHe (the DAO hacker) really screwed the pooch. Reputation is way more valuable than money.\u201d ", "Upon hearing the name Toby Hoenisch, without knowing evidence indicated he was the DAO attacker, Karapetsas, a usually good-humored Greek software developer who was one of the DAO creators and had engaged with him by email and on Reddit, said: \u201cHe was obnoxious\u2026. he was quite insistent on having found a lot of problems.\u201d After hearing that the DarkDAO ETC had been cashed out to a Grin node with Hoenisch\u2019s alias, Karapetsas observed that if Hoenisch had instead remedied the situation while the DarkDao funds were frozen, the Ethereum community would have given him \u201chuge kudos'' for finding the weakness and then returning the ETH. Similarly, Griff Green, whose current projects lean towards helping non-profit and public causes grow in the digital world, believes the hacker missed the chance to \u201cbe a hero.\u201d Says Green: \u201cHe really screwed the pooch...Reputation is way more valuable than money.\u201d", "Ironically, in a 2016 blog post, Hoenisch wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a white hat hacker by heart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0Twenty days later came the DAO attack.", "As I noted earlier,\u00a0after being sent a document laying out the evidence that he was the hacker and asking for comment for my book, Hoenisch wrote that my conclusion is \u201cfactually inaccurate.\u201d He said in that email he could give me more details\u2014and then did not respond to four requests for those details, nor to additional fact checking queries for this article.\u00a0In addition, after receiving the first document detailing the facts I\u2019d gathered, he deleted almost all his Twitter history (though I\u2019ve saved the relevant tweets). ", "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", "n May 2015, Hoenisch and the cofounders of his crypto debit card venture\u2014first known as OneBit\u2014had some success at a Mastercard Masters of Code hackathon in Singapore. They started making the card available that year on an invitation-only basis, because, as Hoenisch explained on Reddit, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to launch a half-assed Bitcoin wallet that gets us in trouble for violating KYC (know your customer) laws. And yes, legal is the main reason we can\u2019t just ship it.\u201d A ", "article at the time said Hoenisch had a background in AI, IT security and cryptography.", "In early 2017, just months after the presumed DAO attacker stopped trying to cash out their ETC, Hoenisch\u2019s team\u2014by then operating as TenX\u2014announced it had received $1 million in seed funding from (among others) Fenbushi Capital, where Ethereum founder Buterin was a general partner. Then came the $80 million ICO. In early 2018, things started to go south for TenX when its card issuer, Wavecrest, was booted from the Visa network, meaning that TenX's users could no longer use their debit cards. ", "On Oct. 1, 2020, TenX announced it was sunsetting its services because its new card issuer, Wirecard SG, had been directed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to cease operations.\u00a0On April 9, 2021, TenX posted a blog called \u201cTenX, Meet Mimo.\u201d It outlined a new business that would offer a euro-pegged stablecoin, which kept its value pegged to a fiat currency such as US dollars or euros or Japanese Yen. The market cap of TenX tokens, which spiked at $535 million, now sits at just $11 million. TenX has rebranded itself as Mimo Capital and is offering holders of TenX tokens mostly worthless MIMO tokens instead at a rate of 0.37 MIMO for each TenX.", "Hosp, who was the public face of the company while there, was booted by Hoenisch and another cofounder in January 2019. This occurred a couple months after some crypto publications reported on Hosp\u2019s past affiliation with an Austrian multi-level marketing scheme. However, before hearing that evidence indicated Hoenisch was the DAO attacker, Hosp said his feeling had been that Hoenisch had perhaps pushed him out over jealousy that Hosp had sold bitcoin at the top of the bubble in late 2017, netting himself $20 million. Meanwhile, Hoenisch had kept all his crypto as the bubble \u2013 and his personal net worth \u2013 deflated. ", "\u201cHe came from a very poor family, he had no experience in investing, and he was in crypto in 2010 but he had literally no money, nothing, when we were in Las Vegas together [in the summer of 2016] he had nothing, and I was doing really well with my investments\u2026 he would always push for getting more salary, for having something nicer.\u201d Hosp also mentioned Hoenisch had to send money home to his mother, who had raised him, as well as his sister and brother, as a single parent.", "As new blockchain applications arise, one of the first uses of crypto\u2014as an anonymity shield\u2014is in retreat. ", "Upon hearing that Hoenisch was the likely DAO attacker, Hosp said he was \u201cgetting goose bumps\u201d and begin recalling details from his interactions with his former partner that now seemed to take on new significance.\u00a0For example, when asked if Hoenisch was into Grin (the privacy coins to which the hacker had cashed out) Hosp said, \u201cYes! Yes, he was. He was fascinated by that\u2026I lost money because of those stupid coins! I invested in them because of him, because he was so fascinated by them.\u201d He said that Hoenisch was also obsessed with building a Bitcoin/Monero \u201catomic swap\u201d \u2013 or a way to use smart contracts to swap between Bitcoin and the privacy coin Monero. At the time, Hosp was confused by that, because he felt there was no market for such a product. Later, Hosp pulled up chats from August 2016, in which Hoenisch seemed excited about the price of ETC, the coin held by the hacker after the ethereum fork. ", "When trying to recall the incident that he believed prompted Hoenisch to close his Reddit, Hosp began searching on his computer and muttered to himself, \u201cHe always used tobyai.\u201d He confirmed that one of Toby\u2019s regular email addresses ended in @toby.ai. ", "Recalled a still astounded Hosp: \u201cFor some weird reason, he was quite well aware of what was happening\u2026He understood more of the DAO hack when I asked him what had happened\u2026than I had found on the internet or anywhere.\u201d"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/", "author_name": "Laura Shin", "author_contrib_type": "Senior Contributor", "author_subcontext_header": "Crypto & Blockchain", "author_about": "", "author_social_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/unchainedwithlaurashin", "https://www.twitter.com/laurashin", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurashin", "https://www.instagram.com/laurashin/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/feed/", "http://www.laurashin.com"]}},

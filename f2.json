Similarly, Griff Green, whose current projects lean towards helping non-profit and public causes grow in the digital world, believes the hacker missed the chance to \u201cbe a hero.\u201d Says Green: \u201cHe really screwed the pooch...Reputation is way more valuable than money.\u201d", "Ironically, in a 2016 blog post, Hoenisch wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a white hat hacker by heart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0Twenty days later came the DAO attack.", "As I noted earlier,\u00a0after being sent a document laying out the evidence that he was the hacker and asking for comment for my book, Hoenisch wrote that my conclusion is \u201cfactually inaccurate.\u201d He said in that email he could give me more details\u2014and then did not respond to four requests for those details, nor to additional fact checking queries for this article.\u00a0In addition, after receiving the first document detailing the facts I\u2019d gathered, he deleted almost all his Twitter history (though I\u2019ve saved the relevant tweets).

And yes, legal is the main reason we can\u2019t just ship it.\u201d A ", "Bitcoin Magazine ", "article at the time said Hoenisch had a background in AI, IT security and cryptography.", "In early 2017, just months after the presumed DAO attacker stopped trying to cash out their ETC, Hoenisch\u2019s team\u2014by then operating as TenX\u2014announced it had received $1 million in seed funding from (among others) Fenbushi Capital, where Ethereum founder Buterin was a general partner.

The market cap of TenX tokens, which spiked at $535 million, now sits at just $11 million. TenX has rebranded itself as Mimo Capital and is offering holders of TenX tokens mostly worthless MIMO tokens instead at a rate of 0.37 MIMO for each TenX.", "Hosp, who was the public face of the company while there, was booted by Hoenisch and another cofounder in January 2019. This occurred a couple months after some crypto publications reported on Hosp\u2019s past affiliation with an Austrian multi-level marketing scheme. However, before hearing that evidence indicated Hoenisch was the DAO attacker, Hosp said his feeling had been that Hoenisch had perhaps pushed him out over jealousy that Hosp had sold bitcoin at the top of the bubble in late 2017, netting himself $20 million. Meanwhile, Hoenisch had kept all his crypto as the bubble \u2013 and his personal net worth \u2013 deflated.

Yes, he was. He was fascinated by that\u2026I lost money because of those stupid coins! I invested in them because of him, because he was so fascinated by them.\u201d He said that Hoenisch was also obsessed with building a Bitcoin/Monero \u201catomic swap\u201d \u2013 or a way to use smart contracts to swap between Bitcoin and the privacy coin Monero. At the time, Hosp was confused by that, because he felt there was no market for such a product. Later, Hosp pulled up chats from August 2016, in which Hoenisch seemed excited about the price of ETC, the coin held by the hacker after the ethereum fork. ", "When trying to recall the incident that he believed prompted Hoenisch to close his Reddit, Hosp began searching on his computer and muttered to himself, \u201cHe always used tobyai.\u201d He confirmed that one of Toby\u2019s regular email addresses ended in @toby.ai. ", "Recalled a still astounded Hosp: \u201cFor some weird reason, he was quite well aware of what was happening\u2026He understood more of the DAO hack when I asked him what had happened\u2026than I had found on the internet or anywhere.\u201d", " ", "MORE FROM FORBES"]},

His go-to drink is Johnnie Walker Black Scotch and he has a similar taste for value in business too.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Finger says, of the 25% increase during the Covid-19 pandemic in apartment rents in key sunbelt cities like Tampa, Austin, Nashville and Houston. He points to rampant new construction nationwide, with so many buildings springing up that 600,000 new units came to market last year \u2014 nearly double the previous record. Meanwhile, those federal stimulus checks that fattened renters\u2019 wallets have been mostly spent and price increases for other necessities, like energy and food, are competing for their remaining dollars.", "\u201cI am absolutely programming for a major correction,\u2019\u2019 says Finger. That\u2019s why this past December he sold half his portfolio \u2014 15,000 units in Houston, Dallas and Atlanta \u2014 to real estate investor Greystar for $2 billion. He thought it was a rich price, equal to about 33 times expected 2022 net operating income (rental income minus expenses) of $60 million. Figuring the package would have fetched some 75% less before Covid-19, Finger concluded, \u201cit would be irresponsible not to sell.\u201d ", "Yet while Finger was a happy seller, Greystar was a happy buyer, says Kevin Kaberna, its investment director, who admires Finger\u2019s vigor and calls him a \u201cprolific developer of the nicest assets in best locations.\u201d With 54,000 units in Houston, Greystar was already the biggest landlord in town and Kaberna insists the market remains fantastic \u2013 he points out the nationwide vacancy rate is down to 5.2%, the lowest in at least 20 years, with outright shortages in the hottest markets. The biggest tailwind trend, says Dallas-based real estate consultant Ron Witten, is the \u201cundoubling\u201d of households as some Millennials (including those who moved home during the early pandemic days) leave their parents\u2019 nests, and others already out on their own jettison annoying roommates.", "How High Can The Rent Go?", "With apartment vacancy rates low and falling, landlords pushed through record rent hikes in 2021. Billionaire Marvy Finger thinks a flood of new rental units will hold down future increases, but other developers are more bullish.", "So what did Finger hold on to? He kept some trophies, like One Park Place, a high-end tower he built in downtown Houston adjacent to Discovery Green park, and 500 Crawford, a luxe mid-rise across the street from Minute Maid Park, where the Astros play. And some properties with sentimental value, like Colony Oaks, the very first two-story walkup complex that he built in Houston in 1960; selling that \u201cwould be like selling my first born.\u201d ", "Significantly, Finger also retained properties that he thought had more appreciation left in their underlying dirt. One fully leased 152-unit complex he built in the 1960s is on seven acres adjacent to the private Duchesne School. \u201cThe school now has nowhere to grow but on to that land,\u201d he muses. The land is currently appraised by the county at $30 million, but he thinks it\u2019s worth a lot more, especially in famously un-zoned Houston, \"the only major city that really has no restrictions to entry,\" he says. \"It's certainly allowed me to develop at will.\" And eventually, to redevelop. Which is why he says, \u201cI think what I\u2019m holding on to is worth more than what I\u2019m selling.\u201d ", "Finger grew up in an entrepreneurial family. In the 1940s his father Hyman moved from the piney woods near Beaumont, Texas and started Finger Furniture. Marvy grew up sweeping floors, selling furniture, and watching as Hyman made the mistake of bringing his brothers into his business. \u201cI saw the clashes he had with his family and I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a part of it,\u2019\u2019 says Finger, whose two brothers died years ago. Finger received an early discharge from the Army after a disorder led to most of his stomach being removed. In his early 20s he learned from mentor Ben McGuire how to combine loans from insurance companies with mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration to build two-story, wood-frame, brick veneered apartments with 100% financing. \u201cYou really could fully leverage them, without any equity at all,\u2019\u2019 he marvels.", "After successfully building dozens of middle-class apartments, Finger almost lost his shirt on his first office building project, which became one of the infamous \u201csee-through\u201d towers that languished empty, with unfinished interiors after the 1982 oil bust. He resolved to stick with apartments but decided to venture beyond the edges of Houston\u2019s endless sprawl\u2014going all the way to Chicago, where he met attorney Barry Nekritz. \u201cThe thing that made Chicago interesting to him was that it had the best transportation network in the country. You could get on a train and into the city and live near a food store,\u2019\u2019 says Nekritz. In Schaumburg, Illinois, Finger\u2019s contractors are now putting finishing touches on a new mid-rise complex located nearby an older (but still nice) one he put up 35 years ago. Says Nekritz, \u201cI\u2019m 83, but he won\u2019t let me retire because he won\u2019t retire.\u201d Finger still enjoys tennis, though a fly-fishing accident in Belize claimed one of his eyes a few years ago. ", "Nearly 30 years ago Finger\u2019s projects attracted the attention of the managers of Harvard University\u2019s now $54 billion endowment, who beginning in 1994 teamed up with him to build 16 projects, many of them in south Florida. Chip Douglas, who ran Harvard\u2019s real estate investments back then, recalls Finger\u2019s pursuit of \u201cthe art of building with quality and making the numbers work.\u201d At one building \u201che didn\u2019t like how the pool turned out so he ripped it up and started over.\u201d After a decade, Finger bought out most of Harvard\u2019s interest, but that prestigious relationship opened doors to all the capital he would ever need. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know Finger from Adam, but they sure as hell knew the Harvard seal,\u2019\u2019 Finger says.", "Since then, the builder has signed on other big name equity partners, including Houston billionaire Fayez Sarofim and the children of the late pipeline tycoon Dan Duncan. He has also built bigger, taller projects, such as the Museum Tower in Houston, appraised by Harris County at $100 million. ", "Along with tapping Texas money, Finger has built off his deep Houston connections. In 2006, he heard from his daughter Jill Jewett, then head of cultural affairs for Houston Mayor Bill White, that billionaire Rich Kinder was working with the city to build a city park called Discovery Green that would transform downtown. Forewarned, Finger scooped up a lot and set to work on a 340-unit high rise called One Park Place that would overlook the new park. Eyebrows raised; there hadn\u2019t been a residential tower built downtown in 20 years. He kitted it out with a replica of the pool at the Ritz-Carlton in Maui and lured a high-end grocery store to the ground floor. \u201cThe number one amenity is a food concession,\u201d he says. Still, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, tenants were hard to find, and it took years to fill the units. \u201cI never thought about risk on that project,\u201d he says now. The building is valued at $158 million. As Houston boomed post-Great Recession, he followed up with a string of luxe projects like the eight-story 500 Crawford, across from Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, and now appraised at $91 million. No vacancies. ", "Finger likes to daydream about what might someday replace the 20 acres with 540 garden apartments at the Creole On Yorktown that he built in the early 1970s with financing from Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns. It was the first and last time he ever incorporated an on-premises bar (a security nightmare). He almost lost the complex to bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, \u201cbut nobody wanted to buy a negative cash flowing property.\u201d Eventually, \u201cHouston\u2019s market did turn,\u201d and he\u2019s owned it ever since, with the tony Galleria neighborhood growing up around it. After the next oil bust in the early 1980s and the savings and loans crisis, Finger picked up some gems at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed to liquidate the failed S&Ls. His purchases included a three-acre parcel in the Galleria where he built a modest complex (valued at $10 million). The site, now adjacent to an Omni Hotel and the tony Houstonian Golf Club & Spa, could someday yield to a redevelopment worth many times that. ", "In late 2019 Finger raised $90 million to erect a new luxury tower on another nearby plot. But he called the project off even before Covid-19 hit, concerned that an inverting yield curve signaled economic trouble ahead. With today\u2019s high demand, that building would have filled up fast, but he doesn\u2019t regret pulling back. \u201cThe fundamentals have to make sense.\u201d When they do, Finger (plus heir apparent daughter Jill and son Edward) has the land on which to erect a number of high-rise redevelopments. He\u2019s in no hurry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now can\u2019t last,\u201d he says, referring to the rampant construction of apartment buildings. In Houston, for example, builders currently hold permits to build 42,000 units, more than twice the normal number. Prices for labor and materials are surging. Having seen bubbles before, Finger is content to wait. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get overbuilt again. The glut is definitely coming.\u201d ", "MORE FROM FORBES"]},

Indeed, the story of The DAO and the six-year quest to identify the hacker, shows a lot about just how far the crypto world and the technology for tracking transactions have both come since the first crypto craze. Today, blockchain technology has gone mainstream.

At the same time, a variety of security and structural concerns were being raised about The DAO, including one that would, ironically, later prove to be crucial to limiting the hacker\u2019s immediate access to the spoils. That problem: withdrawing funds was too hard. Someone wanting to retrieve their money had to first create a \u201cchild DAO\u201d or \u201csplit DAO,\u201d which required not only a high degree of technical knowledge, but also waiting periods after each step and the agreement of anyone else who moved funds into that child DAO.", "On the morning of June 17th, ETH reached a new all-time high of $21.52, making the crypto in The DAO worth $249.6 million.

Yes, he was. He was fascinated by that\u2026I lost money because of those stupid coins!

And, all of the data that is out there is hard to understand because there is different terminology from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The public pays a high cost and is powerless to fix it. We don\u2019t know what we are required to do and what we are allowed to do. We wanted to create a very beautiful and intuitive application to address it.\u201d", "On the platform, a user can enter in an address to instantly see a visual overview of a property with relevant data such as lot area, year built, assessments, improvement value, property details, and number of buildings.

Previously, this work was done by planning departments or the landowner by flipping through code books or map books.", "Next, the user can select from a list of ADU products offered by builders listed on the site, dropping them direct on the property to get a visual and understand the Complaw.

Then, they could come in today with that builder and it would be approved. Done. That\u2019s how simple it would be. They can expand and really make the best use of space without having to buy another lot. It does fit the gap for the by design affordable housing. The fact that Symbium can cut the planning department\u2019s work in half is a huge asset to creating more affordable housing.\u201d", "Symbium surveyed 19,000 homeowners who built ADUs in the previous year and the majority who responded said that they were challenged by not knowing the process and the costs involved and would have been able to save a lot of money if they had access to more information. So, homeowners verified that providing that information up front will be key to keeping the cost of housing down.", "Peters agrees that the digitization of the data is a critical element to adding speed that leads to more affordability. ", "\u201cSpeed is a true impediment to creating affordable solutions,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIf a project is under review for 18 months because you have limited staff or it takes too long to do a review physically, it translates directly to carrying costs on the project such as mortgage payments, interest, property taxes, abatements, all of that stuff. Underwriters for affordable projects will look at that. They will look at a jurisdiction and if they are known to move something quickly investors will go with them because there is less risk.\u201d ", "Future Solutions ", "Symbium is currently only in California but has plans to expand. With the growth, Banijamali expects the same challenges, like jurisdictions that don\u2019t have data in a digitized form; however, she remains dedicated to putting in the hard work to help cities step into the future. ", "Later in March 2022, Symbium will launch a new feature with the City of San Jose to allow the public to submit permit applications online, bypassing the planning department. The user will pay Symbium a small convenience fee to submit permits rather than going to the city\u2019s planning department. So, beyond being able to easily negotiate the feasibility of building an ADU, a homeowner will now be able to check on reroofing their house or improving the driveway.", "In the longer term future, Banijamali wants to evolve Symbium into an online property dashboard where everything that is important to the owner is all there in one place where it can be updated as needed, as opposed to the variety of places that currently house the information."]},

Leave it for the next owner.\u201d", "Harris highly suggests tile reglazing an affordable but smart upgrade. \u201cRe-tiling a bathroom can be really expensive, not to mention the labor shortage and supply chain issues that can delay the delivery of select tile by months. But tile reglazing is magic! It's basically a thick coat of white paint over bad tile, an old bathtub or sink, that makes everything brand-new and white.

A lounge place would be perfect for unwinding after a long day with a book or do some morning meditation.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of spaces incorporate a fireplace,\u201d Swenson observes. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new concept, but I think new construction homes are trending to build with a fireplace feature to add more comfort in a bedroom.\u201d", "The designer also stresses the importance of lighting. \u201cMore clients are requesting a light fixture above the bed or sconces alongside, instead of standard ceiling lighting.

His go-to drink is Johnnie Walker Black Scotch and he has a similar taste for value in business too.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Finger says, of the 25% increase during the Covid-19 pandemic in apartment rents in key sunbelt cities like Tampa, Austin, Nashville and Houston. He points to rampant new construction nationwide, with so many buildings springing up that 600,000 new units came to market last year \u2014 nearly double the previous record. Meanwhile, those federal stimulus checks that fattened renters\u2019 wallets have been mostly spent and price increases for other necessities, like energy and food, are competing for their remaining dollars.", "\u201cI am absolutely programming for a major correction,\u2019\u2019 says Finger. That\u2019s why this past December he sold half his portfolio \u2014 15,000 units in Houston, Dallas and Atlanta \u2014 to real estate investor Greystar for $2 billion. He thought it was a rich price, equal to about 33 times expected 2022 net operating income (rental income minus expenses) of $60 million. Figuring the package would have fetched some 75% less before Covid-19, Finger concluded, \u201cit would be irresponsible not to sell.\u201d ", "Yet while Finger was a happy seller, Greystar was a happy buyer, says Kevin Kaberna, its investment director, who admires Finger\u2019s vigor and calls him a \u201cprolific developer of the nicest assets in best locations.\u201d With 54,000 units in Houston, Greystar was already the biggest landlord in town and Kaberna insists the market remains fantastic \u2013 he points out the nationwide vacancy rate is down to 5.2%, the lowest in at least 20 years, with outright shortages in the hottest markets. The biggest tailwind trend, says Dallas-based real estate consultant Ron Witten, is the \u201cundoubling\u201d of households as some Millennials (including those who moved home during the early pandemic days) leave their parents\u2019 nests, and others already out on their own jettison annoying roommates.", "How High Can The Rent Go?", "With apartment vacancy rates low and falling, landlords pushed through record rent hikes in 2021. Billionaire Marvy Finger thinks a flood of new rental units will hold down future increases, but other developers are more bullish.", "So what did Finger hold on to? He kept some trophies, like One Park Place, a high-end tower he built in downtown Houston adjacent to Discovery Green park, and 500 Crawford, a luxe mid-rise across the street from Minute Maid Park, where the Astros play. And some properties with sentimental value, like Colony Oaks, the very first two-story walkup complex that he built in Houston in 1960; selling that \u201cwould be like selling my first born.\u201d ", "Significantly, Finger also retained properties that he thought had more appreciation left in their underlying dirt. One fully leased 152-unit complex he built in the 1960s is on seven acres adjacent to the private Duchesne School. \u201cThe school now has nowhere to grow but on to that land,\u201d he muses. The land is currently appraised by the county at $30 million, but he thinks it\u2019s worth a lot more, especially in famously un-zoned Houston, \"the only major city that really has no restrictions to entry,\" he says. \"It's certainly allowed me to develop at will.\" And eventually, to redevelop. Which is why he says, \u201cI think what I\u2019m holding on to is worth more than what I\u2019m selling.\u201d ", "Finger grew up in an entrepreneurial family. In the 1940s his father Hyman moved from the piney woods near Beaumont, Texas and started Finger Furniture. Marvy grew up sweeping floors, selling furniture, and watching as Hyman made the mistake of bringing his brothers into his business. \u201cI saw the clashes he had with his family and I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a part of it,\u2019\u2019 says Finger, whose two brothers died years ago. Finger received an early discharge from the Army after a disorder led to most of his stomach being removed. In his early 20s he learned from mentor Ben McGuire how to combine loans from insurance companies with mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration to build two-story, wood-frame, brick veneered apartments with 100% financing. \u201cYou really could fully leverage them, without any equity at all,\u2019\u2019 he marvels.", "After successfully building dozens of middle-class apartments, Finger almost lost his shirt on his first office building project, which became one of the infamous \u201csee-through\u201d towers that languished empty, with unfinished interiors after the 1982 oil bust. He resolved to stick with apartments but decided to venture beyond the edges of Houston\u2019s endless sprawl\u2014going all the way to Chicago, where he met attorney Barry Nekritz. \u201cThe thing that made Chicago interesting to him was that it had the best transportation network in the country. You could get on a train and into the city and live near a food store,\u2019\u2019 says Nekritz. In Schaumburg, Illinois, Finger\u2019s contractors are now putting finishing touches on a new mid-rise complex located nearby an older (but still nice) one he put up 35 years ago. Says Nekritz, \u201cI\u2019m 83, but he won\u2019t let me retire because he won\u2019t retire.\u201d Finger still enjoys tennis, though a fly-fishing accident in Belize claimed one of his eyes a few years ago. ", "Nearly 30 years ago Finger\u2019s projects attracted the attention of the managers of Harvard University\u2019s now $54 billion endowment, who beginning in 1994 teamed up with him to build 16 projects, many of them in south Florida. Chip Douglas, who ran Harvard\u2019s real estate investments back then, recalls Finger\u2019s pursuit of \u201cthe art of building with quality and making the numbers work.\u201d At one building \u201che didn\u2019t like how the pool turned out so he ripped it up and started over.\u201d After a decade, Finger bought out most of Harvard\u2019s interest, but that prestigious relationship opened doors to all the capital he would ever need. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know Finger from Adam, but they sure as hell knew the Harvard seal,\u2019\u2019 Finger says.", "Since then, the builder has signed on other big name equity partners, including Houston billionaire Fayez Sarofim and the children of the late pipeline tycoon Dan Duncan. He has also built bigger, taller projects, such as the Museum Tower in Houston, appraised by Harris County at $100 million. ", "Along with tapping Texas money, Finger has built off his deep Houston connections. In 2006, he heard from his daughter Jill Jewett, then head of cultural affairs for Houston Mayor Bill White, that billionaire Rich Kinder was working with the city to build a city park called Discovery Green that would transform downtown. Forewarned, Finger scooped up a lot and set to work on a 340-unit high rise called One Park Place that would overlook the new park. Eyebrows raised; there hadn\u2019t been a residential tower built downtown in 20 years. He kitted it out with a replica of the pool at the Ritz-Carlton in Maui and lured a high-end grocery store to the ground floor. \u201cThe number one amenity is a food concession,\u201d he says. Still, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, tenants were hard to find, and it took years to fill the units. \u201cI never thought about risk on that project,\u201d he says now. The building is valued at $158 million. As Houston boomed post-Great Recession, he followed up with a string of luxe projects like the eight-story 500 Crawford, across from Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, and now appraised at $91 million. No vacancies. ", "Finger likes to daydream about what might someday replace the 20 acres with 540 garden apartments at the Creole On Yorktown that he built in the early 1970s with financing from Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns. It was the first and last time he ever incorporated an on-premises bar (a security nightmare). He almost lost the complex to bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, \u201cbut nobody wanted to buy a negative cash flowing property.\u201d Eventually, \u201cHouston\u2019s market did turn,\u201d and he\u2019s owned it ever since, with the tony Galleria neighborhood growing up around it. After the next oil bust in the early 1980s and the savings and loans crisis, Finger picked up some gems at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed to liquidate the failed S&Ls. His purchases included a three-acre parcel in the Galleria where he built a modest complex (valued at $10 million). The site, now adjacent to an Omni Hotel and the tony Houstonian Golf Club & Spa, could someday yield to a redevelopment worth many times that. ", "In late 2019 Finger raised $90 million to erect a new luxury tower on another nearby plot. But he called the project off even before Covid-19 hit, concerned that an inverting yield curve signaled economic trouble ahead. With today\u2019s high demand, that building would have filled up fast, but he doesn\u2019t regret pulling back. \u201cThe fundamentals have to make sense.\u201d When they do, Finger (plus heir apparent daughter Jill and son Edward) has the land on which to erect a number of high-rise redevelopments. He\u2019s in no hurry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now can\u2019t last,\u201d he says, referring to the rampant construction of apartment buildings. In Houston, for example, builders currently hold permits to build 42,000 units, more than twice the normal number. Prices for labor and materials are surging. Having seen bubbles before, Finger is content to wait. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get overbuilt again.

It is different from the last two releases of 2012 and 2013, but then again, it should be, as this is a prestige cuv\u00e9e that reflects the particulars of each growing season. Recent releases, such as 2012 and 2008, display the variances in the vintages and in the finished wines; 2008 was a powerful vintage throughout Champagne, while 2012 was more refined.

Thankfully, this has not been the case, as CEO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rouzaud and cellar master Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon have consistently made the necessary efforts to elevate Roederer Cristal to even greater heights. The house is among the leading proponents of biodynamic farming, and since 2012, Cristal is made entirely from grapes farmed with this approach; the image above shows how these vineyards are tended by plow horses, eliminating a great deal of human and chemical intervention.", "The rainy, cool climate of Champagne can make biodynamic farming, with its specific demands (no pesticides, the use of supplements in the soil), a rather difficult task in this region, yet Roederer has endorsed this manner of viticulture for the past two decades. The results have been remarkable, as the style of Cristal, as well as its other top cuv\u00e9es has become more refined.

It\u2019s not the same style as the 2008 or 2012, two remarkable vintages, nor should it be. 2014 was rather rainy during the spring, and early predictions were not great, but as noted on the Roederer website, \u201cSeptember was hot, sunny, and very dry ... weather we would usually associate with the month of August.\u201d This resulted in ideal ripening, while acidity levels were excellent; the resulting wine displays impeccable harmony. ", "So the 2014 Roederer Cristal is another great success; open a bottle and you\u2019ll not only impress your guests, but you\u2019ll also be thrilled at how graceful, complex, and yes, delicious, this cuv\u00e9e truly is!", "2014 Roederer Cristal ", "- A blend of 60% Pinot Noir, 40% Chardonnay; 32% of the wine was aged in oak; dosage of 7 grams per liter (thus a Brut classification).

Medium-full, the wine glides across the palate; there is an extremely lengthy finish that is remarkably polished and sensual. Never overpowering in any aspect, this is as elegant and as understated a release of this wine in several years.

The Red Hood survived the fall, but was disfigured by the chemicals and driven mad by it (although he was perhaps already on the road to insanity), causing the clown-like appearance that leads to his new identity as the Joker.", "In ", "The Batman", ", Keoghan has blisters and burns all over his exposed skin. His hair has burned off or fallen out on the sides and back of his head, his lips are cracked and split, his grin extended by hideous burns and scars (akin to \u2014 but more severe than \u2014 Heath Ledger\u2019s \u201cJoker smile\u201d in The Dark Knight, and as originally envisioned by comic book artist Lee Bermejo in his Joker designs).

His malevolence is matched by a playfulness, though, that suggests a playful joy at getting Batman\u2019s goat. There are no threats or homicidal suggestions from Joker himself, and he even gives Batman some useful insights (although Batman clearly doesn\u2019t fully realize it at the time) about the Riddler and the Riddler\u2019s motives. This pre-Joker is having fun playing along and ribbing Batman, building toward his sucker punch at the end.", "I\u2019ve previously written my own thoughts about how a Joker character might fit into Matt Reeves\u2019 bat-world, ", "which you can read ", "here", ". The gist of it is, I wanted a Joker who was more focused on trying to undermine Batman\u2019s sense of himself and to damage Batman\u2019s public image. Specifically, I wanted to see a Joker more akin to the character from the 1960s TV series, but homicidal \u2014 with the caveat that his violence and darkness didn\u2019t overshadow his clownishness, and that he also spent a lot of time setting up pranks on Batman as opposed to always focusing on body counts.", "While Keoghan\u2019s pre-Joker is obviously still of the \u201cout-edgy Batman\u201d variety that\u2019s been popular now for decades, he also has a sprite-like quality and actual sense of humor throughout, and seems like the sort who will enjoy poking Batman in the eye more than threats of murder and death.", "It would be cool to get at least a brief flashback or two of this character as the Red Hood, perhaps in a movie starring Keoghan\u2019s Joker as the main villain, but it\u2019s not necessary. It won\u2019t take much to establish the fact he\u2019s burned and scarred from an unintended chemical bath, and that it renders his true identity impossible to ascertain anymore (his fingerprints may have been irreparably burned or otherwise damaged).", "When next we see him, I\u2019d bet his skin is at least slightly healed \u2014 enough that he\u2019s not covered in scars, but still retains the \u201cGlasgow smile\u201d and hairlessness on the sides and back of his head. And he\u2019ll probably wear lipstick.", "But I don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll see the Joker as the main villain any time soon. Reeves has made it clear he wants to pursue a few other villains, including Mister Freeze for example, and he isn\u2019t even sure if he will wind up using the Joker at all again for his own movies.", "That\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t see the Joker in Reeves\u2019 bat-world, though. I fully expect him to appear in the upcoming HBO Max spinoff series focusing on Arkham Asylum. Originally intended as ", "Gotham PD", ", the series has \u2014 like the villains themselves \u2014 transformed into something new, different, and more eerie. Which means Joker is probably going to feature in the series, alongside some other bat-villains (perhaps Paul Dano\u2019s Riddler will be there as well). If he does appear in the series, that might be the most likely place to see any flashbacks to his Red Hood days and Batman sending him into the vat of chemicals.", "The Batman", " has already topped $600+ million in its theatrical run, and is on course to pass $700+ million by the end of its run. The film arrives on HBO Max on April 19th.", "UPDATE:", " I should add a note that although Matt Reeves has said in interviews that he approached the Joker character with the idea that the character was born with a congenital condition that affected his appearance, he didn\u2019t really get into which aspects are pre-existing conditions and which are from other sources (injuries, chemicals, intentional self-alteration).", "The filmmaker has also made it clear (in publicly released on-camera interviews, and back in the Q&A from early February after our initial screening event) he went into the film without knowing whether he\u2019d ever use the Joker again besides this cameo, so the ideas are more vague and weren\u2019t part of a larger detailed plan for Joker and his backstory.", "This leaves lots of room to adjust, retcon, or alter aspects of the incarnation \u2014 and Reeves says this character has already fought Batman in the past, so he has a prior history as a villain with Batman. Since I don\u2019t think green hair is a grounded idea for a congenital condition, and since some of Joker\u2019s appearance seems to obviously be scars and injuries, I think by the time we see Keoghan\u2019s Joker again, there will be more to his backstory and history with Batman."]},

A lounge place would be perfect for unwinding after a long day with a book or do some morning meditation.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of spaces incorporate a fireplace,\u201d Swenson observes. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new concept, but I think new construction homes are trending to build with a fireplace feature to add more comfort in a bedroom.\u201d", "The designer also stresses the importance of lighting. \u201cMore clients are requesting a light fixture above the bed or sconces alongside, instead of standard ceiling lighting.

I think creating a very comfortable space will be very beneficial to everyone as we get older \u2014 and nothing beats music therapy.\u201d ", "Numerous health publications and services, including the ", "Mayo Clinic", ", support her perspective, citing the reduction of stress, anxiety and depression music can bring to those with Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.

A parent can also add a \u2018Bedtime Basket,\u2019 with items that the child can use to self-soothe to sleep. These could be books, picture books, puzzles, drawing pads, small toys and so on.

Bean bag chairs, a small sectional, or an extra pull out bed could all be a warm welcome for visitors,\u201d she suggest.

These include devices like starlight projectors or music players that turn off later. Their rooms should look and sound exactly the same all night, she says. The second factor is anything that a child or teen can\u2019t manage independently. \u201cFor example, some parents use weighted blankets that the child can\u2019t replace if the blanket falls off of the bed or comes untucked, for example.\u201d", "Final Thoughts ", "\u201cI love that people are seeing convenience as almost a necessity now,\u201d Swenson declares.

This was not an idle question, as this was a friend who closely follows the latest trends from the region and tastes numerous current releases; as he had not heard much in the way of great reports about this vintage, he wondered if the 2014 Cristal was anything special. ", "As you\u2019ll see from my review at the end of this article, the wine was indeed quite alluring. It is different from the last two releases of 2012 and 2013, but then again, it should be, as this is a prestige cuv\u00e9e that reflects the particulars of each growing season. Recent releases, such as 2012 and 2008, display the variances in the vintages and in the finished wines; 2008 was a powerful vintage throughout Champagne, while 2012 was more refined. Yet both were first-rate examples of Cristal, which is saying something.", "Cristal was first produced by the house of Louis Roederer of Reims in 1876 for Tsar Alexander II of Russia, who was an enthusiast of the firm\u2019s Champagnes, but wanted something a bit more unique. That original release was packaged in a crystal bottle, hence the name, and for almost 150 years, the name Cristal has come to be identified with this highly distinctive, iconic Champagne. ", "Given the value of this marque and its familiarity with consumers around the world, it would be easy for the principals at Roederer to rest on their laurels. Thankfully, this has not been the case, as CEO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rouzaud and cellar master Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon have consistently made the necessary efforts to elevate Roederer Cristal to even greater heights. The house is among the leading proponents of biodynamic farming, and since 2012, Cristal is made entirely from grapes farmed with this approach; the image above shows how these vineyards are tended by plow horses, eliminating a great deal of human and chemical intervention.", "The rainy, cool climate of Champagne can make biodynamic farming, with its specific demands (no pesticides, the use of supplements in the soil), a rather difficult task in this region, yet Roederer has endorsed this manner of viticulture for the past two decades. The results have been remarkable, as the style of Cristal, as well as its other top cuv\u00e9es has become more refined. I used to think of Cristal as a powerhouse Champagne that was a bit disjointed upon release, but the wine for me now is more elegant than ever, as yes, more distinguished. ", "So getting back to the 2014. It\u2019s not the same style as the 2008 or 2012, two remarkable vintages, nor should it be. 2014 was rather rainy during the spring, and early predictions were not great, but as noted on the Roederer website, \u201cSeptember was hot, sunny, and very dry ... weather we would usually associate with the month of August.\u201d This resulted in ideal ripening, while acidity levels were excellent; the resulting wine displays impeccable harmony. ", "So the 2014 Roederer Cristal is another great success; open a bottle and you\u2019ll not only impress your guests, but you\u2019ll also be thrilled at how graceful, complex, and yes, delicious, this cuv\u00e9e truly is!", "2014 Roederer Cristal ", "- A blend of 60% Pinot Noir, 40% Chardonnay; 32% of the wine was aged in oak; dosage of 7 grams per liter (thus a Brut classification). Light yellow with a beautiful, persistent stream of small bubbles. Lovely aromas of pear, lemon zest and magnolia. Medium-full, the wine glides across the palate; there is an extremely lengthy finish that is remarkably polished and sensual. Never overpowering in any aspect, this is as elegant and as understated a release of this wine in several years. Absolutely delicious now, this has the acidity and texture to drink well for many years - a signature of Cristal - with peak in 10-12 years or perhaps a few years longer.

The story takes place after actor Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman has already been operating in Gotham City for a year, so we are witnessing the aftermath of his war on regular street crime, organized gangs, and corruption, but prior to the takeover of Gotham\u2019s crime by the rogues gallery of so-called \u201cfreak\u201d villains.", "This, then, is the moment when Batman experiences the transformation of certain people into his arch enemies.

The Red Hood survived the fall, but was disfigured by the chemicals and driven mad by it (although he was perhaps already on the road to insanity), causing the clown-like appearance that leads to his new identity as the Joker.", "In ", "The Batman", ", Keoghan has blisters and burns all over his exposed skin. His hair has burned off or fallen out on the sides and back of his head, his lips are cracked and split, his grin extended by hideous burns and scars (akin to \u2014 but more severe than \u2014 Heath Ledger\u2019s \u201cJoker smile\u201d in The Dark Knight, and as originally envisioned by comic book artist Lee Bermejo in his Joker designs). His skin is chalky and dry, his remaining top hair green.

His malevolence is matched by a playfulness, though, that suggests a playful joy at getting Batman\u2019s goat. There are no threats or homicidal suggestions from Joker himself, and he even gives Batman some useful insights (although Batman clearly doesn\u2019t fully realize it at the time) about the Riddler and the Riddler\u2019s motives. This pre-Joker is having fun playing along and ribbing Batman, building toward his sucker punch at the end.", "I\u2019ve previously written my own thoughts about how a Joker character might fit into Matt Reeves\u2019 bat-world, ", "which you can read ", "here", ". The gist of it is, I wanted a Joker who was more focused on trying to undermine Batman\u2019s sense of himself and to damage Batman\u2019s public image. Specifically, I wanted to see a Joker more akin to the character from the 1960s TV series, but homicidal \u2014 with the caveat that his violence and darkness didn\u2019t overshadow his clownishness, and that he also spent a lot of time setting up pranks on Batman as opposed to always focusing on body counts.", "While Keoghan\u2019s pre-Joker is obviously still of the \u201cout-edgy Batman\u201d variety that\u2019s been popular now for decades, he also has a sprite-like quality and actual sense of humor throughout, and seems like the sort who will enjoy poking Batman in the eye more than threats of murder and death.", "It would be cool to get at least a brief flashback or two of this character as the Red Hood, perhaps in a movie starring Keoghan\u2019s Joker as the main villain, but it\u2019s not necessary. It won\u2019t take much to establish the fact he\u2019s burned and scarred from an unintended chemical bath, and that it renders his true identity impossible to ascertain anymore (his fingerprints may have been irreparably burned or otherwise damaged).", "When next we see him, I\u2019d bet his skin is at least slightly healed \u2014 enough that he\u2019s not covered in scars, but still retains the \u201cGlasgow smile\u201d and hairlessness on the sides and back of his head. And he\u2019ll probably wear lipstick.", "But I don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll see the Joker as the main villain any time soon. Reeves has made it clear he wants to pursue a few other villains, including Mister Freeze for example, and he isn\u2019t even sure if he will wind up using the Joker at all again for his own movies.", "That\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t see the Joker in Reeves\u2019 bat-world, though. I fully expect him to appear in the upcoming HBO Max spinoff series focusing on Arkham Asylum. Originally intended as ", "Gotham PD", ", the series has \u2014 like the villains themselves \u2014 transformed into something new, different, and more eerie. Which means Joker is probably going to feature in the series, alongside some other bat-villains (perhaps Paul Dano\u2019s Riddler will be there as well). If he does appear in the series, that might be the most likely place to see any flashbacks to his Red Hood days and Batman sending him into the vat of chemicals.", "The Batman", " has already topped $600+ million in its theatrical run, and is on course to pass $700+ million by the end of its run. The film arrives on HBO Max on April 19th.", "UPDATE:", " I should add a note that although Matt Reeves has said in interviews that he approached the Joker character with the idea that the character was born with a congenital condition that affected his appearance, he didn\u2019t really get into which aspects are pre-existing conditions and which are from other sources (injuries, chemicals, intentional self-alteration).", "The filmmaker has also made it clear (in publicly released on-camera interviews, and back in the Q&A from early February after our initial screening event) he went into the film without knowing whether he\u2019d ever use the Joker again besides this cameo, so the ideas are more vague and weren\u2019t part of a larger detailed plan for Joker and his backstory.", "This leaves lots of room to adjust, retcon, or alter aspects of the incarnation \u2014 and Reeves says this character has already fought Batman in the past, so he has a prior history as a villain with Batman. Since I don\u2019t think green hair is a grounded idea for a congenital condition, and since some of Joker\u2019s appearance seems to obviously be scars and injuries, I think by the time we see Keoghan\u2019s Joker again, there will be more to his backstory and history with Batman."], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/", "author_name": null, "author_contrib_type": null, "author_subcontext_header": null, "author_about": "", "author_social_links": []}},

(Cofounder and CEO Tristan Handy told ", "Forbes", " that the company could still have raised at $6.2 billion if it wanted to but instead chose to raise at a lower valuation to protect employee stock options.)", "While funding and valuations are trending down, investors say there is no reason to panic and this might be a needed respite. \u201cIt takes a while for founders, boards, employees to adjust from what they think they are worth,\u201d Eric Paley, a partner at Founder Collective, tells ", "Forbes", ". \u201cIt was probably the greatest multiples expansion in tech ever over the last few years.

Many firms increased their pace last year to keep up with the market\u2019s speed, but that doesn\u2019t change the set investment periods their funds are on or the amount of investments they told LPs they would be making. They might be pulling back just to balance out, he says. ", "Paley says that the market should enjoy the period of calm. He describes the past two years as the market being on its toes, leaning forward into the stories and the dreams of the entrepreneurial pitches they are hearing. It hasn\u2019t dropped back to its heels, he says, but rather onto the balls of its feet. ", "\u201cIt would be reasonable to say that as much as the public market is going down it is still relatively aggressive compared to historical multiples,\u201d Paley says. \u201cIt\u2019s coming more in line with historic multiples. It's not even at the historical norm.\u201d", "Both Paley and Goldberg say that exiting last year\u2019s environment that prompted founders to consistently raise as funds banged down their doors, is actually a good thing. Paley called the constant fundraising \u201cinefficient entrepreneurship\u201d and Goldberg says not having that pressure to constantly raise means founders will be able to actually focus on building their companies. ", "But all three agree, good companies will still be able to raise this year with little to no problems if the trend continues as is. U.S.-based venture funds alone raised $128 billion last year and have plenty of powder to deploy. It will just depend a lot more on business economics than on a company\u2019s 2021 growth story. ", "\u201cI think for the top 5% or 10% of companies, nothing changes from last year,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cIf you are an exceptional business you are unaffected by the macro conditions.\u201d"]},

A decade ago \u2013 well before the likes of Spotify were so ubiquitous \u2013 Mekikian\u2019s daughters set him a challenge after a scare at their school, where a fellow student accessing an illegal music downloads site was targeted by cyber attackers. He recalls: \u201cThey said, \u201cDad, you\u2019re an engineer, why can\u2019t you solve this problem?\u2019.\u201d", "Mekikian got to work and started developing what would become Trebel, which launched formally in 2018. Today, the app offers consumers the opportunity to download their favourite music to play offline. It\u2019s completely free of charge \u2013 and completely legal, with Trebel having signed deals with three of the largest record labels in the world in Sony Music, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group.", "Now the company is looking to take its next step, with an ambitious initial public offering that hopes to harness the power of the crowd through a Regulation A offering \u2013 a stock issue that is open to the investing public as well as institutional investors. \u201cSo many of our subscribers have been in touch asking how they could invest that this route made real sense,\u201d Mekikian says. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen the value of services like Spotify grow and they think Trebel could follow.\u201d", "To be clear, Mekikian sees its market as completely different to the established streaming services \u2013 and a far bigger one. \u200d\"Nearly 90% of the world's 3.5 billion smartphone users do not pay for music,\u201d Mekikian points out. In many cases, it\u2019s because they can\u2019t afford such costs.", "Trebel\u2019s business model therefore targets those mobile phone users \u2013 essentially all 3.5 billion of them, minus a few hundred million who pay for a streaming service. The company makes its money by selling advertising that is served up to users as they\u2019re browsing for music and as they\u2019re downloading songs to play offline.", "Mekikian sees that as a win-win situation for everybody involved. Advertisers are currently getting very few opportunities to put out high-quality content on smartphones, despite the market reach of these devices, so Trebel works well for them. Users unable to pay to stream music can now get it for free. And the music labels benefit too \u2013 they, and their artists, earn royalties when Trebel users download their tracks.", "\u201cThe labels have been very welcoming, because we\u2019re effectively a new revenue stream for the artists,\u201d Mekikian says. \u201cWe\u2019re monetising people who have not previously been monetised.\u201d", "In fact, that\u2019s not strictly true. Some people have been monetising this audience \u2013 just not in a legal way. Mekikian believes Trebel will take many people away from illicit websites that offer pirated music. It\u2019s not credible to think people aren\u2019t going to use these sites to access the music they love, he says, unless you give them an alternative that is free, but legal.", "\u201cFor many young people in particular, music isn\u2019t something that\u2019s optional \u2013 it\u2019s as crucial to them as air and water,\u201d Mekikian says. \u201cWhy should the only option for kids who can\u2019t pay be these sinister online operators that may not be safe - and which are definitely not rewarding the artists that listeners love.\u201d", "It\u2019s a compelling pitch that appears to be capturing listeners\u2019 imagination. Trebel has started out in North America, targeting the US and, in particular, Mexico, where it has overtaken Spotify as the number one app in Mexico's Google Play store in the free music category.", "Mekikian sees the world\u2019s emerging economies as particularly good options for the company and is now planning launches across South-East Asia, beginning with Indonesia. In many of these markets, smartphone penetration is high, but disposable incomes lag those in advanced economies, limiting the number of people for whom subscription-based music services are an option.", "Customer growth has been rapid. Since the launch of the app in its fully-fledged form in 2019, Trebel has picked up around 5 million active users, while continuing to test its model and trial new features. It\u2019s a strong start \u2013 but in the context of a global addressable market in the billions, there is plenty of potential for expansion.", "\u201cWe think we\u2019re ready for our next phase of growth,\u201d Mekikian says \u2013 hence the securities issue. He hopes investors from all around the world will become brand ambassadors for Trebel, using its service and evangelising its benefits to their friends and families. \u201cIt\u2019s all about getting the word out,\u201d Mekikian says."]},

Although WWE has made a habit out of gutting its roster in recent years, the ", "expected upcoming return", " of AEW founding father Cody Rhodes could be the start of a seismic shift in pro wrestling free agency and roster development.", "Rhodes appears to be the first major ex-AEW talent to jump ship to WWE, and the latter would be absolutely foolish not to make a play for MJF in early 2024. After all, one of the biggest issues plaguing WWE over the past decade-plus has been its inability to consistently churn out new stars. While the likes of Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, Alexa Bliss and a number of others have remained cornerstones of WWE during that span, WWE has been unable to frequently take young performers in their early-to-mid-20s and turn them into main event stars for much of the past two decades.", "That\u2019s why WrestleMania 38 is going to rely so heavily on part-time stars and celebrities, like Brock Lesnar and Ronda Rousey.

Because it\u2019s a constant reminder of Tony Khan, okay, I need to step my game up. And it\u2019s a constant reminder for WWE, who has extreme interest in me, okay, we\u2019re gonna need to make him a serious offer that he can\u2019t refuse.\u201d", "AEW gives MJF the ability to walk the line between the acceptable and the controversial in a way that WWE likely never would, as WWE has watered down a number of acts both in the ring and on the microphone in order for them to \u201cfit\u201d the notorious WWE style. There are pros and cons to that, but someone like MJF would more likely than not have the rug pulled from underneath him in WWE.", "Likewise, there are questions about whether WWE would truly back up the Brinks truck for MJF, especially given the way the company has unceremoniously dumped money-making acts like Bray Wyatt in the past due to perceived budget cuts. Of course, WWE makes exceptions for legendary all-time performers, like Lesnar, Edge or The Undertaker, and has paid them handsomely in recent years for limited workloads.", "But will MJF, at not even 30, be considered in that same stratosphere in just two years time? That\u2019s nearly impossible to predict.", "MJF\u2019s career trajectory up to this point suggests that he is well on his way to becoming a first ballot Hall of Famer and the type of do-it-all performer who fans remember for decades, but he\u2019s reached that level pretty much exclusively in AEW. And as any pro wrestling star who\u2019s worked for WWE can attest to, WWE is a whole different animal, one with tricky waters to navigate and a certain head of creative who has stripped down many acts that once seemed like sure things.", "So, while MJF may not be closing the door on WWE just yet, maybe he will come January 2024."]},

", "\u201cWith adaptations you have to make those hard decisions,\u201d said Hugh. \u201cNow this is something I want to clarify. This is meant to be an ongoing series. Eight episodes isn\u2019t the whole series. But still, even in an ongoing series, you need to make choices. What to add that wasn\u2019t in the book or what to take away.

The big haunting question of the show, that I knew the show would hang on, is \u2018survival yes, but at what cost.\u2019 Sunja and Solomon make very different decisions under that question. That\u2019s the journey we go on through the season.\u201d ", "Not only were sections of the novel saved for subsequent seasons, but backstory was added for one character.

It was an in joke. It wasn't people just buying the red hoodie, they were buying the person behind it and a sense of community that comes with that.\"", "\"That sense of community goes beyond brand loyalty.

The company makes its money by selling advertising that is served up to users as they\u2019re browsing for music and as they\u2019re downloading songs to play offline.", "Mekikian sees that as a win-win situation for everybody involved. Advertisers are currently getting very few opportunities to put out high-quality content on smartphones, despite the market reach of these devices, so Trebel works well for them. Users unable to pay to stream music can now get it for free.

Some people have been monetising this audience \u2013 just not in a legal way. Mekikian believes Trebel will take many people away from illicit websites that offer pirated music. It\u2019s not credible to think people aren\u2019t going to use these sites to access the music they love, he says, unless you give them an alternative that is free, but legal.", "\u201cFor many young people in particular, music isn\u2019t something that\u2019s optional \u2013 it\u2019s as crucial to them as air and water,\u201d Mekikian says. \u201cWhy should the only option for kids who can\u2019t pay be these sinister online operators that may not be safe - and which are definitely not rewarding the artists that listeners love.\u201d", "It\u2019s a compelling pitch that appears to be capturing listeners\u2019 imagination. Trebel has started out in North America, targeting the US and, in particular, Mexico, where it has overtaken Spotify as the number one app in Mexico's Google Play store in the free music category.", "Mekikian sees the world\u2019s emerging economies as particularly good options for the company and is now planning launches across South-East Asia, beginning with Indonesia. In many of these markets, smartphone penetration is high, but disposable incomes lag those in advanced economies, limiting the number of people for whom subscription-based music services are an option.", "Customer growth has been rapid. Since the launch of the app in its fully-fledged form in 2019, Trebel has picked up around 5 million active users, while continuing to test its model and trial new features. It\u2019s a strong start \u2013 but in the context of a global addressable market in the billions, there is plenty of potential for expansion.", "\u201cWe think we\u2019re ready for our next phase of growth,\u201d Mekikian says \u2013 hence the securities issue.

Their work was based on the chemical manipulation of nucleotides and proved highly successful in identifying and replicating short DNA sequences.

Currently, most enzymatic DNA synthesis relies on the use of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), an enzyme responsible for introducing \u201cextra\u201d nucleotides into the gene splicing process2. The purported benefits of enzymatic synthesis include the ability to avoid the use of harsh chemical substances (which often results in toxic waste) and an ever-increasing ability to produce longer and longer DNA strands\u2026 which in turn, result in not only a more \u201cgreen\u201d form of DNA synthesis but also some incredibly powerful new uses for the longer DNA chains (e.g., vaccines, therapeutics, and data storage).", "Five companies lead the market in DNA enzymatic synthesis: ", "Molecular Assemblies", ", ", "DNA Script", ", ", "Bit Bio", ", ", "Evonetix", ", and ", "Ansa Biotechnologies", ".

Because it\u2019s a constant reminder of Tony Khan, okay, I need to step my game up. And it\u2019s a constant reminder for WWE, who has extreme interest in me, okay, we\u2019re gonna need to make him a serious offer that he can\u2019t refuse.\u201d", "AEW gives MJF the ability to walk the line between the acceptable and the controversial in a way that WWE likely never would, as WWE has watered down a number of acts both in the ring and on the microphone in order for them to \u201cfit\u201d the notorious WWE style. There are pros and cons to that, but someone like MJF would more likely than not have the rug pulled from underneath him in WWE.", "Likewise, there are questions about whether WWE would truly back up the Brinks truck for MJF, especially given the way the company has unceremoniously dumped money-making acts like Bray Wyatt in the past due to perceived budget cuts. Of course, WWE makes exceptions for legendary all-time performers, like Lesnar, Edge or The Undertaker, and has paid them handsomely in recent years for limited workloads.", "But will MJF, at not even 30, be considered in that same stratosphere in just two years time? That\u2019s nearly impossible to predict.", "MJF\u2019s career trajectory up to this point suggests that he is well on his way to becoming a first ballot Hall of Famer and the type of do-it-all performer who fans remember for decades, but he\u2019s reached that level pretty much exclusively in AEW. And as any pro wrestling star who\u2019s worked for WWE can attest to, WWE is a whole different animal, one with tricky waters to navigate and a certain head of creative who has stripped down many acts that once seemed like sure things.", "So, while MJF may not be closing the door on WWE just yet, maybe he will come January 2024."], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/", "author_name": null, "author_contrib_type": null, "author_subcontext_header": null, "author_about": "", "author_social_links": []}},

This is no criminal extradition, but a welcoming committee, including a caravan of limousines and Mercedes-Benzes, each with two armed bodyguards. The entourage speeds along Ukraine's pockmarked highways, through traffic lights, past lonely farms and dusty roads to the village of Zhitomir.", "Leviev is a local hero. He restored this town's only remaining synagogue, which the Nazis had turned into an arms depot and communists converted to a cinema. Now a ragtag klezmer band serenades him as photographers snap pictures and boys perform a traditional Hasidic dance in his honor. Across some 400 villages in Russia and the former Soviet republics this scene has been replayed countless times. Leviev is a 47-year-old, Uzbeki-born Israeli citizen and devout Lubavitcher who gives away at least $30 million a year in order to return lost Jews to the flock.", "This little-known billionaire is also the scourge of De Beers, the giant miner and marketer of diamonds, known as the \"Syndicate.\" Leviev was once a sightholder, one of a few exclusive direct buyers of De Beers rough diamonds. Today he is the world's largest cutter and polisher of the precious gems and a primary source of rough stones to other cutters, polishers and jewelry makers around the globe. Those who have watched his rise over the last three decades say it was his intense hatred of De Beers that fueled him. He bristled under the Syndicate's high-handed treatment of buyers, who were given boxes of rough diamonds at take-it-or-leave-it prices and risked being permanently cut off if they balked.", "Leviev won't openly criticize his former South African business partner. But his defiance seems thinly disguised. \"I'm not going to let anyone else tell me how to run my business,\" he says. \"I grew up in the Soviet Union. I knew what it was to be afraid. I can remember being beaten regularly by the bullies at school, and I said to myself I would never be afraid of anybody or anything again.\"", "Indeed, he has taken significant business away from De Beers in Russia and Angola\u2014two of the world's largest producers of rough diamonds in terms of value. Leviev has not humbled the once-mighty Syndicate alone. But his defiance has inspired others, like Rio Tinto, owner of Australia's Argyle mine, which bypassed De Beers for the first time in 1996 to sell its 42 million carats directly to polishers in Antwerp. In the early 1990s the Russian government began selling some of its rough supply to others, despite its longtime exclusive deal with De Beers. When miners discovered massive diamond reserves in Canada's Northwest Territories, De Beers had to scramble for a piece. Its share of the rough-diamond market, 80% five years ago, has been cut to 60%.", "The reason Leviev is such a threat is that he has profoundly shaken the tradition-bound diamond business. Until recently De Beers had a virtual chokehold on world supplies, determining who could buy uncut stones\u2014and at what quantities and quality\u2014and where the cutting centers were allowed to prosper. Leviev pulled an end run around the cartel, dealing directly with diamond-producing governments and shattering De Beers' all-important relationship with sightholders. He also became the industry's first diamond dealer with his finger on every facet of production, from mining and cutting to polishing and retailing, capturing profits at every stage.", "Trumping De Beers, Leviev has become very rich. He owns 100% of his diamond business, Lev Leviev Group, and a controlling stake in Africa Israel Investments. The latter is a Yehud, Israel-based conglomerate whose holdings include: commercial real estate in Prague and London; Gottex, a swimwear company; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S.; 173 7-Elevens in New Mexico and Texas; a 33% stake in Cross Israel Highway, that nation's first toll road; and an 85% share of Vash Telecanal, Israel's Russian-language TV channel. Leviev also owns a gold mine in Kazakhstan, pieces of two diamond mines in Angola and mining licenses in the Urals and Namibia. He's probably worth $2 billion.", "A part of that wealth comes from exploiting political connections\u2014which has created enmity and suspicion. A recent example: When Leviev was preparing a bid for 40% of Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the banks supporting him pulled out at the last moment. Sources say it was a lack of transparency in Leviev's business. Even if his hands are clean, Leviev has dealt with people whose mitts are dirty. His ubiquitous brigade of burly armed guards isn't just for show.", "Some of Russia's Jewish establishment resent Leviev's pushing his own brand of Hasidism. He has drawn fire for seeing to it that a Lubavitch rabbi, born in Italy and educated in America, was granted citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Leviev installed him as the country's chief rabbi, though the nation already had one. He's playing with fire, critics say, by aligning himself so closely with Putin. Should the president turn on him, Leviev's Jewish activities could be seen as violating the promise Russia's oligarchs made to Putin to stay out of politics in order to keep their assets\u2014many of which were notoriously acquired in the early 1990s.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. Leviev has also become something of a go-to guy between Israel and central Asian countries, enlisting the secular regimes in those mainly Islamic states in the fight against fundamentalist terror groups. Leviev, who now lives in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Israel, is a close associate of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the presidents of Kazakhstan and his native Uzbekistan. Among his pals in Africa are presidents Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia.", "Leviev grew up in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Though under communism his family was committed to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, and all the males, Leviev included, learned to perform ritual circumcisions in secret. Leviev's father Avner was a successful textile merchant and a collector of rare Persian carpets. After seven years of waiting, the family emigrated to Israel in 1971, having converted their wealth into $1 million in rough diamonds, which they smuggled out of the country. But when they tried to unload them in Israel, they were told the diamonds were of inferior quality, worth only $200,000. Leviev, 15 at the time, vowed to right the wrong. Over his father's objections, he left yeshiva and a life of religious education to take up diamond-cutting.", "He opened his own cutting factory in 1977\u2014when speculation in the burgeoning Israeli diamond market went unchecked. Most cutters held inventory, betting on ever-rising prices. When the market collapsed three years later, banks stopped extending credit and many cutters went bust. Leviev hadn't borrowed against his inventory and was in good enough shape to expand to 12 small factories over the next five years. Scrambling to find enough rough diamonds, he flew frequently to London, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Siberia. He also adapted laser technology and acquired cutting software\u2014a revolutionary innovation at the time\u2014to capture more value from his precious supply. Later his cutters could produce digital 3-D models of various diamond cuts, taking into account imperfections, size, weight and shape before touching the stone. \"Part of his genius,\" says Charles Wyndham, cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants and a former director of De Beers' selling arm, \"was marrying cutting-edge technology to exactly what the market wanted.\"", "In 1987 De Beers invited Leviev to become a sightholder, a plum position granted to fewer than 150 people. By then he was one of Israel's largest manufacturers of polished stones. Two years later Russia's state-run diamond mining and selling group, now called Alrosa, asked Leviev to help it set up its own cutting factories\u2014the first time any rough diamonds were finished in the country of their origin\u2014in a joint venture called Ruis. (For decades De Beers has been channeling all rough diamonds through its Diamond Trading Co. in London before reselling them to sightholders at a markup; a diamond mined in, say, Africa traveled halfway around the world before it was resold to a sightholder in Africa.) Today, Leviev owns 100% of Ruis, which cuts $140 million worth of diamonds a year, and polishing operations, including one in Perm, Russia, another in Armenia.", "Leviev horned in on the business by cultivating a cozy relationship with Valery Rudakov, who under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran Alrosa. The partnership opened the Kremlin door for Leviev. \"I never spoke about business with Gorbachev,\" Leviev insists. \"I talked to him about opening Jewish schools where there had been none for 70 years.\" But he probably confirmed Rudakov's suspicions (and those of Gorby) that De Beers was lowballing the country on the value of its gems.", "Leviev's deal gave him a piece of Russia's rough-diamond supply, and gave De Beers fits. By 1995 it had had enough of this upstart and booted him from the sightholders' circle. It is widely believed that Leviev, perhaps anticipating the Syndicate's retaliation, had already secured rough supply from Gokhran, Russia's repository of gems, gold, art and antiques, run by Boris Yeltsin pal Yevgeni Bychkov. The Russian government had decided to unload some of the rough and polished stones it had been accumulating for a long time, probably since 1955\u2014a hoard worth as much as $12 billion in the early 1990s, according to Chaim Even-Zohar, publisher in Ramat Gan, Israel of the influential trade journal ", "Diamond Intelligence Briefs", ". It is widely believed that Leviev became a primary means of liquidating the stockpile. What's more, the stockpile contained some of the most precious stones in the world, 100 carats and larger, says Richard Wake-Walker, a cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants. \"The incredible quality we were seeing couldn't come from a year's mining,\" says Barry Berg, vice president of international sales for William Goldberg Diamond, a Manhattan firm that took advantage of the unparalleled deluge. By 1997 a significant portion of that stockpile was gone.", "Was all that liquidation licit? \"That's what state reserves are for,\" says Rudakov, who is now chairman of a Norilsk Nickel unit. \"When a country is in distress it can sell off those reserves.\"", "Clearly, though, there were less legitimate uses. \"There were one or more Kremlin slush funds, and a variety of questionable benefits were distributed,\" says John Helmer, a veteran U.S. business correspondent in Russia. \"Some of the proceeds went to electioneering, some to offshore accounts and some to individual pockets.\" In 1998 Thomas Kneir, then a deputy assistant director at the FBI, testified before a House banking subcommittee about the smuggling of proceeds from the sale of Russia's state assets, including diamonds, into foreign accounts during the loosey-goosey days of early capitalism. Kneir cited the Golden ADA affair, in which rough diamonds worth $170 million were shipped from Russia to a plant it set up in San Francisco, where they were to be cut and polished. But, says Matthew Hart, author of ", "Diamond", ", the gems and cash disappeared along the way, spent on luxury homes and political payoffs. (Bychkov, charged with abuse of power in connection with Golden ADA, was later pardoned by Yeltsin.)", "If he was the conduit for many transactions, Leviev would have raked it in. \"You buy it today, sell it an hour later and get paid tomorrow,\" explains Manhattan buyer Barry Berg. Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly.", "Whatever he was up to during the Yeltsin years, he kept a low profile. Leviev avoided being identified with the \"Family,\" a group of newly hatched tycoons who tried to convert their economic influence into political power. A smart move, because when Putin became president, he marginalized some Family members, like Boris Berezovsky. Leviev had kept close ties with Putin, brokering meetings for the first time between the new Russian president and prominent Israeli politicos.", "While De Beers struggled in the mid-1990s to deal with Leviev in Russia, it had another problem on its hands closer to home: blood diamonds, the ones that paid for knives and guns. Angola, the world's third-largest producer of rough diamonds, was overrun with rebel forces opposed to President Dos Santos. The rebels took control of the diamond territories and flooded the market with up to $1.2 billion in diamonds a year. De Beers had little choice but to buy the stuff or risk losing its grip on prices, according to the London-based group Global Witness.", "Blood diamonds became a PR migraine for De Beers. In 1998 the United Nations slapped sanctions on the buying of Angolan diamonds from the rebels; a widely circulated report by Global Witness singled out De Beers for \"operat[ing] with an extraordinary lack of accountability.\" Under pressure, the Syndicate closed its buying offices in Angola and the war-pocked Democratic Republic of Congo, while continuing to explore in Angola.", "Leviev had already made a mark in Angola in 1996 when he came through with a $60 million investment, in exchange for 16% of Angola's largest diamond mine, after the government took it back from the rebels. Alrosa, a partner, couldn't come up with the cash. \"Dos Santos said I was the only one who helped his country,\" says Leviev, who guarded his mines with former Israeli intelligence agents. (He and the president bonded, says a report from the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, over their knowledge of Russian and mutual loathing of De Beers.) Leviev also offered to generate more state revenues and promised to cut down on illegal exports. To sweeten the pot, he gave the Angolan government a 51% share of Angola Selling Corp., or Ascorp, the exclusive buyer of Angolan rough diamonds. (Industry insiders whisper that Isabella Dos Santos, the president's daughter, has a separate stake in Ascorp. Leviev says he knows nothing of it.)", "There's more to the story than Leviev cares to discuss. A friend of his, Arcady Gaydamak, an alleged arms dealer with Israeli and Russian citizenship, was an adviser to Dos Santos. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the mid 1990s Gaydamak (wanted in France for illegal arms trafficking) negotiated a forgiveness of Angolan debt to Russia, in exchange for arms. In January 2000, a month after Leviev's Ascorp was awarded the exclusive on Angola's diamonds, Gaydamak bought 15% of Leviev's Africa Israel Investments. Within a year Leviev bought back Gaydamak's stake. A quid pro quo? \"He offered to sell me the shares at a good price,\" says Leviev. \"This was a time before Mr. Gaydamak had legal problems.\" While the two are no longer business associates, they remain chums.", "Leviev apparently delivered on his word to Dos Santos: The government's reported tax collections from diamond sales jumped to $62 million last year from $10 million in 1998. A lot more than that was smuggled out of the country, contends Even-Zohar. Buying up $1 billion worth of Angolan rough diamonds a year strained Leviev, who was under constant pressure to unload the minerals quickly. He couldn't consistently offer miners the best prices. \"So diggers knew they could get far more for their stones, and that led to rampant smuggling,\" says Even-Zohar.", "That may help explain why Leviev lost his Angolan exclusive this summer. When asked about being dropped, Leviev shrugs. \"Don't count me out yet.\"", "He had left a long trail of ill will with De Beers in Angola. In March of 2000 the Syndicate persuaded a Belgian judge to seize a small diamond shipment that turned out to be Leviev's. He successfully petitioned to have the stones returned a few months later. De Beers still contends the 1998 contract with Leviev's Ascorp is invalid and is trying to get its Angolan rights restored and recover $92 million it says it is owed by the Dos Santos government.", "The Syndicate had reason to fight. Ascorp's deal meant that for the first time, De Beers would have had to sell the output of its own mines to someone else\u2014in this case, its archenemy. By May 2001 the company exited Angola entirely.", "Next flashpoint: Namibia, a country rich with diamonds that De Beers has mined since Ernest Oppenheimer bought the concessions after World War I. But like Russia, Namibia wanted to process its own rocks, so in 2000 it forced producers to sell a regular supply of rough diamonds to domestic cutters. De Beers balked, but later relented and built a cutting factory with Namibia\u2014but supplies it with rough from its own London offices.", "Again Leviev exploited the situation. In 2000 he paid $30 million for 37% of Namibian Minerals Corp. (Namco), an offshore diamond mining outfit. As part of the deal, he agreed to open a polishing factory on the Namibian coast. Later, when Namco's mining equipment broke down, Leviev feuded with his partners when they refused to put up more money for repairs. So he got even, forcing the company into bankruptcy, then buying all its mining concessions for a pittance\u2014an estimated $3 million.", "His partnerships in Russia, Angola and Namibia represent part of Leviev's play for direct ownership of rough supplies\u2014geopolitically diversified. He has recently bought a piece of Camafuca in northeast Angola and a diamond exploration licence in Russia's Ural mountains. (Allegedly, he unsuccessfully bid for a piece of Alexkor, South Africa's state-owned diamond mining company. He also failed in an attempt to trade his Namco concessions for a chunk of Trans Hex Group, a publicly traded mining outfit based in Cape Town; one likely stumbling block was his links to Arcady Gaydamak. Leviev denies making either bid.) If Russia's Alrosa, still a state-owned asset, should be privatized, Putin pal Leviev would certainly be on any short list of potential buyers.", "Leviev boasts: \"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" But De Beers has been moving vertically, too. Its loss of market dominance pushed it into the retail end. It formed a joint venture with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, unveiled in 2000, to create an upscale brand that would fetch a premium over unbranded diamonds. Each partner put up $200 million, hoping for the kind of margins that would compensate for the loss of share in the mining side of the business. But so far, all it's done is create collateral damage. In July De Beers dropped 35 of its 120 longtime sightholders (adding 10 new ones), raising rampant speculation that it was keeping its best supplies for its retail operation. De Beers vigorously denies this and says it cut the sightholders following its \"objective [review] process.\" (Still, the move created quite a stir in Manhattan's 47th Street Diamond District; see sidebar above).", "De Beers LV, as the partnership is known, hasn't made the expected splash. So far there's just one stand-alone store, on London's Bond Street. A planned Madison Avenue store has been delayed indefinitely.", "Still, the De Beers-driven branding trend has caught fire. Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with fashion house Escada to create the 12-sided \"Escada cut\" for its signature jewelry line. Leo Schachter Diamonds, a Tel Aviv-based sightholder, spent at least $5 million to advertise its 66-faceted Leo diamond in magazines like ", "People", " and ", "Vanity Fair", ". While Tiffany patented the Lucida diamond, a 50-facet square cut, New York's William Goldberg produced the antique-looking Ashoka variety. Even Leviev is launching his own high-end jewelry line, dubbed the Vivid Collection, hoarding his best stones for pieces priced from $50,000 to a few million dollars.", "Leviev is also moving beyond the ancient game of one-upmanship\u2014and beyond the dirty business of diamonds. You see it in his latest investments. With partners, he's financing $1 billion in real estate development in Russia over the next four years, including three office buildings in central Moscow, and expects to put up a similar amount for office and residential complexes in New York City, Dallas and San Antonio. You can also see it in his political activities. In June he brokered a meeting in Moscow between Putin and American Jewish leaders, including James Tisch, chief executive of Loews Corp., to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.", "Perhaps his religious philanthropy is his ultimate reach for legitimacy. Lately he has expanded his Chabad initiatives, once confined to Russia and other former Soviet republics, to the West. This year he is setting up a school in Dresden to teach nonreligious Jewish emigres about the faith. Last year he opened a new school in Queens, N.Y. that caters to 350 Jewish students whose families formerly lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. \"It's about staying true to the legacy of my father,\" he says. \"All I want is for people in these places to know they are Jewish.\" A moment later he is whisked through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where a caravan of heavily guarded SUVs awaits.", "MORE FROM FORBES"]},

(If the foundation distributes more than 5% in one year, it can carry forward the excess for five years. If the percentage is not met, the foundation simply pays more in taxes).\u00a0\u00a0", "Up until now, at least, Musk has ranked among the less charitable billionaires in the world, especially relative to the size of his fortune.

Of that, about $20 million landed in a DAF. The remaining $2.9 million primarily went to education-related causes.

But until then,\u00a0it\u2019s best to remember that he gave away the largest amount he\u2019s ever given the same year that he sold the most Tesla stock and exercised the most Tesla options ever. As a result, the reason for the stock gift probably had more to do with lowering his tax bill than anything else.

He restored this town's only remaining synagogue, which the Nazis had turned into an arms depot and communists converted to a cinema. Now a ragtag klezmer band serenades him as photographers snap pictures and boys perform a traditional Hasidic dance in his honor. Across some 400 villages in Russia and the former Soviet republics this scene has been replayed countless times. Leviev is a 47-year-old, Uzbeki-born Israeli citizen and devout Lubavitcher who gives away at least $30 million a year in order to return lost Jews to the flock.", "This little-known billionaire is also the scourge of De Beers, the giant miner and marketer of diamonds, known as the \"Syndicate.\" Leviev was once a sightholder, one of a few exclusive direct buyers of De Beers rough diamonds. Today he is the world's largest cutter and polisher of the precious gems and a primary source of rough stones to other cutters, polishers and jewelry makers around the globe. Those who have watched his rise over the last three decades say it was his intense hatred of De Beers that fueled him. He bristled under the Syndicate's high-handed treatment of buyers, who were given boxes of rough diamonds at take-it-or-leave-it prices and risked being permanently cut off if they balked.", "Leviev won't openly criticize his former South African business partner. But his defiance seems thinly disguised. \"I'm not going to let anyone else tell me how to run my business,\" he says. \"I grew up in the Soviet Union. I knew what it was to be afraid. I can remember being beaten regularly by the bullies at school, and I said to myself I would never be afraid of anybody or anything again.\"", "Indeed, he has taken significant business away from De Beers in Russia and Angola\u2014two of the world's largest producers of rough diamonds in terms of value. Leviev has not humbled the once-mighty Syndicate alone. But his defiance has inspired others, like Rio Tinto, owner of Australia's Argyle mine, which bypassed De Beers for the first time in 1996 to sell its 42 million carats directly to polishers in Antwerp. In the early 1990s the Russian government began selling some of its rough supply to others, despite its longtime exclusive deal with De Beers. When miners discovered massive diamond reserves in Canada's Northwest Territories, De Beers had to scramble for a piece. Its share of the rough-diamond market, 80% five years ago, has been cut to 60%.", "The reason Leviev is such a threat is that he has profoundly shaken the tradition-bound diamond business. Until recently De Beers had a virtual chokehold on world supplies, determining who could buy uncut stones\u2014and at what quantities and quality\u2014and where the cutting centers were allowed to prosper. Leviev pulled an end run around the cartel, dealing directly with diamond-producing governments and shattering De Beers' all-important relationship with sightholders. He also became the industry's first diamond dealer with his finger on every facet of production, from mining and cutting to polishing and retailing, capturing profits at every stage.", "Trumping De Beers, Leviev has become very rich. He owns 100% of his diamond business, Lev Leviev Group, and a controlling stake in Africa Israel Investments. The latter is a Yehud, Israel-based conglomerate whose holdings include: commercial real estate in Prague and London; Gottex, a swimwear company; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S.; 173 7-Elevens in New Mexico and Texas; a 33% stake in Cross Israel Highway, that nation's first toll road; and an 85% share of Vash Telecanal, Israel's Russian-language TV channel. Leviev also owns a gold mine in Kazakhstan, pieces of two diamond mines in Angola and mining licenses in the Urals and Namibia. He's probably worth $2 billion.", "A part of that wealth comes from exploiting political connections\u2014which has created enmity and suspicion. A recent example: When Leviev was preparing a bid for 40% of Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the banks supporting him pulled out at the last moment. Sources say it was a lack of transparency in Leviev's business. Even if his hands are clean, Leviev has dealt with people whose mitts are dirty. His ubiquitous brigade of burly armed guards isn't just for show.", "Some of Russia's Jewish establishment resent Leviev's pushing his own brand of Hasidism. He has drawn fire for seeing to it that a Lubavitch rabbi, born in Italy and educated in America, was granted citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Leviev installed him as the country's chief rabbi, though the nation already had one. He's playing with fire, critics say, by aligning himself so closely with Putin. Should the president turn on him, Leviev's Jewish activities could be seen as violating the promise Russia's oligarchs made to Putin to stay out of politics in order to keep their assets\u2014many of which were notoriously acquired in the early 1990s.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. Leviev has also become something of a go-to guy between Israel and central Asian countries, enlisting the secular regimes in those mainly Islamic states in the fight against fundamentalist terror groups. Leviev, who now lives in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Israel, is a close associate of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the presidents of Kazakhstan and his native Uzbekistan. Among his pals in Africa are presidents Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia.", "Leviev grew up in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Though under communism his family was committed to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, and all the males, Leviev included, learned to perform ritual circumcisions in secret. Leviev's father Avner was a successful textile merchant and a collector of rare Persian carpets. After seven years of waiting, the family emigrated to Israel in 1971, having converted their wealth into $1 million in rough diamonds, which they smuggled out of the country. But when they tried to unload them in Israel, they were told the diamonds were of inferior quality, worth only $200,000. Leviev, 15 at the time, vowed to right the wrong. Over his father's objections, he left yeshiva and a life of religious education to take up diamond-cutting.", "He opened his own cutting factory in 1977\u2014when speculation in the burgeoning Israeli diamond market went unchecked. Most cutters held inventory, betting on ever-rising prices. When the market collapsed three years later, banks stopped extending credit and many cutters went bust. Leviev hadn't borrowed against his inventory and was in good enough shape to expand to 12 small factories over the next five years. Scrambling to find enough rough diamonds, he flew frequently to London, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Siberia. He also adapted laser technology and acquired cutting software\u2014a revolutionary innovation at the time\u2014to capture more value from his precious supply. Later his cutters could produce digital 3-D models of various diamond cuts, taking into account imperfections, size, weight and shape before touching the stone. \"Part of his genius,\" says Charles Wyndham, cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants and a former director of De Beers' selling arm, \"was marrying cutting-edge technology to exactly what the market wanted.\"", "In 1987 De Beers invited Leviev to become a sightholder, a plum position granted to fewer than 150 people. By then he was one of Israel's largest manufacturers of polished stones. Two years later Russia's state-run diamond mining and selling group, now called Alrosa, asked Leviev to help it set up its own cutting factories\u2014the first time any rough diamonds were finished in the country of their origin\u2014in a joint venture called Ruis. (For decades De Beers has been channeling all rough diamonds through its Diamond Trading Co. in London before reselling them to sightholders at a markup; a diamond mined in, say, Africa traveled halfway around the world before it was resold to a sightholder in Africa.) Today, Leviev owns 100% of Ruis, which cuts $140 million worth of diamonds a year, and polishing operations, including one in Perm, Russia, another in Armenia.", "Leviev horned in on the business by cultivating a cozy relationship with Valery Rudakov, who under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran Alrosa. The partnership opened the Kremlin door for Leviev. \"I never spoke about business with Gorbachev,\" Leviev insists. \"I talked to him about opening Jewish schools where there had been none for 70 years.\" But he probably confirmed Rudakov's suspicions (and those of Gorby) that De Beers was lowballing the country on the value of its gems.", "Leviev's deal gave him a piece of Russia's rough-diamond supply, and gave De Beers fits. By 1995 it had had enough of this upstart and booted him from the sightholders' circle. It is widely believed that Leviev, perhaps anticipating the Syndicate's retaliation, had already secured rough supply from Gokhran, Russia's repository of gems, gold, art and antiques, run by Boris Yeltsin pal Yevgeni Bychkov. The Russian government had decided to unload some of the rough and polished stones it had been accumulating for a long time, probably since 1955\u2014a hoard worth as much as $12 billion in the early 1990s, according to Chaim Even-Zohar, publisher in Ramat Gan, Israel of the influential trade journal ", "Diamond Intelligence Briefs", ". It is widely believed that Leviev became a primary means of liquidating the stockpile. What's more, the stockpile contained some of the most precious stones in the world, 100 carats and larger, says Richard Wake-Walker, a cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants. \"The incredible quality we were seeing couldn't come from a year's mining,\" says Barry Berg, vice president of international sales for William Goldberg Diamond, a Manhattan firm that took advantage of the unparalleled deluge. By 1997 a significant portion of that stockpile was gone.", "Was all that liquidation licit? \"That's what state reserves are for,\" says Rudakov, who is now chairman of a Norilsk Nickel unit. \"When a country is in distress it can sell off those reserves.\"", "Clearly, though, there were less legitimate uses. \"There were one or more Kremlin slush funds, and a variety of questionable benefits were distributed,\" says John Helmer, a veteran U.S. business correspondent in Russia. \"Some of the proceeds went to electioneering, some to offshore accounts and some to individual pockets.\" In 1998 Thomas Kneir, then a deputy assistant director at the FBI, testified before a House banking subcommittee about the smuggling of proceeds from the sale of Russia's state assets, including diamonds, into foreign accounts during the loosey-goosey days of early capitalism. Kneir cited the Golden ADA affair, in which rough diamonds worth $170 million were shipped from Russia to a plant it set up in San Francisco, where they were to be cut and polished. But, says Matthew Hart, author of ", "Diamond", ", the gems and cash disappeared along the way, spent on luxury homes and political payoffs. (Bychkov, charged with abuse of power in connection with Golden ADA, was later pardoned by Yeltsin.)", "If he was the conduit for many transactions, Leviev would have raked it in. \"You buy it today, sell it an hour later and get paid tomorrow,\" explains Manhattan buyer Barry Berg. Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly.", "Whatever he was up to during the Yeltsin years, he kept a low profile. Leviev avoided being identified with the \"Family,\" a group of newly hatched tycoons who tried to convert their economic influence into political power. A smart move, because when Putin became president, he marginalized some Family members, like Boris Berezovsky. Leviev had kept close ties with Putin, brokering meetings for the first time between the new Russian president and prominent Israeli politicos.", "While De Beers struggled in the mid-1990s to deal with Leviev in Russia, it had another problem on its hands closer to home: blood diamonds, the ones that paid for knives and guns. Angola, the world's third-largest producer of rough diamonds, was overrun with rebel forces opposed to President Dos Santos. The rebels took control of the diamond territories and flooded the market with up to $1.2 billion in diamonds a year. De Beers had little choice but to buy the stuff or risk losing its grip on prices, according to the London-based group Global Witness.", "Blood diamonds became a PR migraine for De Beers. In 1998 the United Nations slapped sanctions on the buying of Angolan diamonds from the rebels; a widely circulated report by Global Witness singled out De Beers for \"operat[ing] with an extraordinary lack of accountability.\" Under pressure, the Syndicate closed its buying offices in Angola and the war-pocked Democratic Republic of Congo, while continuing to explore in Angola.", "Leviev had already made a mark in Angola in 1996 when he came through with a $60 million investment, in exchange for 16% of Angola's largest diamond mine, after the government took it back from the rebels. Alrosa, a partner, couldn't come up with the cash. \"Dos Santos said I was the only one who helped his country,\" says Leviev, who guarded his mines with former Israeli intelligence agents. (He and the president bonded, says a report from the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, over their knowledge of Russian and mutual loathing of De Beers.) Leviev also offered to generate more state revenues and promised to cut down on illegal exports. To sweeten the pot, he gave the Angolan government a 51% share of Angola Selling Corp., or Ascorp, the exclusive buyer of Angolan rough diamonds. (Industry insiders whisper that Isabella Dos Santos, the president's daughter, has a separate stake in Ascorp. Leviev says he knows nothing of it.)", "There's more to the story than Leviev cares to discuss. A friend of his, Arcady Gaydamak, an alleged arms dealer with Israeli and Russian citizenship, was an adviser to Dos Santos. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the mid 1990s Gaydamak (wanted in France for illegal arms trafficking) negotiated a forgiveness of Angolan debt to Russia, in exchange for arms. In January 2000, a month after Leviev's Ascorp was awarded the exclusive on Angola's diamonds, Gaydamak bought 15% of Leviev's Africa Israel Investments. Within a year Leviev bought back Gaydamak's stake. A quid pro quo? \"He offered to sell me the shares at a good price,\" says Leviev. \"This was a time before Mr. Gaydamak had legal problems.\" While the two are no longer business associates, they remain chums.", "Leviev apparently delivered on his word to Dos Santos: The government's reported tax collections from diamond sales jumped to $62 million last year from $10 million in 1998. A lot more than that was smuggled out of the country, contends Even-Zohar. Buying up $1 billion worth of Angolan rough diamonds a year strained Leviev, who was under constant pressure to unload the minerals quickly. He couldn't consistently offer miners the best prices. \"So diggers knew they could get far more for their stones, and that led to rampant smuggling,\" says Even-Zohar.", "That may help explain why Leviev lost his Angolan exclusive this summer. When asked about being dropped, Leviev shrugs. \"Don't count me out yet.\"", "He had left a long trail of ill will with De Beers in Angola. In March of 2000 the Syndicate persuaded a Belgian judge to seize a small diamond shipment that turned out to be Leviev's. He successfully petitioned to have the stones returned a few months later. De Beers still contends the 1998 contract with Leviev's Ascorp is invalid and is trying to get its Angolan rights restored and recover $92 million it says it is owed by the Dos Santos government.", "The Syndicate had reason to fight. Ascorp's deal meant that for the first time, De Beers would have had to sell the output of its own mines to someone else\u2014in this case, its archenemy. By May 2001 the company exited Angola entirely.", "Next flashpoint: Namibia, a country rich with diamonds that De Beers has mined since Ernest Oppenheimer bought the concessions after World War I. But like Russia, Namibia wanted to process its own rocks, so in 2000 it forced producers to sell a regular supply of rough diamonds to domestic cutters. De Beers balked, but later relented and built a cutting factory with Namibia\u2014but supplies it with rough from its own London offices.", "Again Leviev exploited the situation. In 2000 he paid $30 million for 37% of Namibian Minerals Corp. (Namco), an offshore diamond mining outfit. As part of the deal, he agreed to open a polishing factory on the Namibian coast. Later, when Namco's mining equipment broke down, Leviev feuded with his partners when they refused to put up more money for repairs. So he got even, forcing the company into bankruptcy, then buying all its mining concessions for a pittance\u2014an estimated $3 million.", "His partnerships in Russia, Angola and Namibia represent part of Leviev's play for direct ownership of rough supplies\u2014geopolitically diversified. He has recently bought a piece of Camafuca in northeast Angola and a diamond exploration licence in Russia's Ural mountains. (Allegedly, he unsuccessfully bid for a piece of Alexkor, South Africa's state-owned diamond mining company. He also failed in an attempt to trade his Namco concessions for a chunk of Trans Hex Group, a publicly traded mining outfit based in Cape Town; one likely stumbling block was his links to Arcady Gaydamak. Leviev denies making either bid.) If Russia's Alrosa, still a state-owned asset, should be privatized, Putin pal Leviev would certainly be on any short list of potential buyers.", "Leviev boasts: \"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" But De Beers has been moving vertically, too. Its loss of market dominance pushed it into the retail end. It formed a joint venture with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, unveiled in 2000, to create an upscale brand that would fetch a premium over unbranded diamonds. Each partner put up $200 million, hoping for the kind of margins that would compensate for the loss of share in the mining side of the business. But so far, all it's done is create collateral damage. In July De Beers dropped 35 of its 120 longtime sightholders (adding 10 new ones), raising rampant speculation that it was keeping its best supplies for its retail operation. De Beers vigorously denies this and says it cut the sightholders following its \"objective [review] process.\" (Still, the move created quite a stir in Manhattan's 47th Street Diamond District; see sidebar above).", "De Beers LV, as the partnership is known, hasn't made the expected splash. So far there's just one stand-alone store, on London's Bond Street. A planned Madison Avenue store has been delayed indefinitely.", "Still, the De Beers-driven branding trend has caught fire. Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with fashion house Escada to create the 12-sided \"Escada cut\" for its signature jewelry line. Leo Schachter Diamonds, a Tel Aviv-based sightholder, spent at least $5 million to advertise its 66-faceted Leo diamond in magazines like ", "People", " and ", "Vanity Fair", ". While Tiffany patented the Lucida diamond, a 50-facet square cut, New York's William Goldberg produced the antique-looking Ashoka variety. Even Leviev is launching his own high-end jewelry line, dubbed the Vivid Collection, hoarding his best stones for pieces priced from $50,000 to a few million dollars.", "Leviev is also moving beyond the ancient game of one-upmanship\u2014and beyond the dirty business of diamonds. You see it in his latest investments. With partners, he's financing $1 billion in real estate development in Russia over the next four years, including three office buildings in central Moscow, and expects to put up a similar amount for office and residential complexes in New York City, Dallas and San Antonio. You can also see it in his political activities. In June he brokered a meeting in Moscow between Putin and American Jewish leaders, including James Tisch, chief executive of Loews Corp., to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.", "Perhaps his religious philanthropy is his ultimate reach for legitimacy. Lately he has expanded his Chabad initiatives, once confined to Russia and other former Soviet republics, to the West. This year he is setting up a school in Dresden to teach nonreligious Jewish emigres about the faith. Last year he opened a new school in Queens, N.Y. that caters to 350 Jewish students whose families formerly lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. \"It's about staying true to the legacy of my father,\" he says. \"All I want is for people in these places to know they are Jewish.\" A moment later he is whisked through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where a caravan of heavily guarded SUVs awaits.", "MORE FROM FORBES"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/", "author_name": "Chase Peterson-Withorn", "author_contrib_type": "Forbes Staff", "author_subcontext_header": "Billionaires", "author_about": "I cover the most successful entrepreneurs doing the biggest deals on the planet.

As we begin to come together more frequently, we\u2019re looking at a much broader view of how we provide flexibility and balance across the company, with most of our workforce likely having a hybrid schedule, which will look very different team to team, and sometimes even among teams. It\u2019s going to take some iteration and new ways to build our community; but I think that this will overall result in a workforce that is more efficient, agile and creative, because people will have the ability to work in ways that take their needs \u2013 and the needs of the business and our customers \u2013 into account.", "Investing in technology and creating collaborative spaces is also imperative to implementing a flexible workplace approach.

The start of Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP preceded a stock boom that brought clients at home and early international expansion to Europe. ", "Twenty years later, amid early growth in the number of U.S. listings by Chinese companies and then-warm ties between the two countries, Bernstein flew to northeast China to meet a potential customer from a privately owned that wanted to go public. There, Bernstein recalled in a recent interview, he had \u201cthe hubris\u201d to think he was ready to conduct accounting audits in a country still in a messy transition from its Maoist days toward a market-focused, globalized economy.", "It paid off. Bernstein & Pinchuk spun off the China portion of the business into a joint venture with Marcum LLP in 2011. Now, MBP, the combined firm Bernstein co-chairs, has nearly 200 people working in mainland China, including six partners in five cities that represent an example of American entrepreneurial success in the country. ", "Yet times are changing. Geopolitics combined with regulatory uncertainties in the China and the U.S. have slowed once-booming New York and Nasdaq listings by the growing mainland businesses such as Alibaba, JD.com and Netease. Though plans unveiled this Tuesday for a SPAC (or special-purpose acquisition company) listing by Shanghai-based Fosun International\u2019s Lanvin Group would be worth more than $1 billion, the recent flow of China IPOs in the U.S. has been paltry. Meihua International Medical Technologies raised only $36 million before it began trading on the Nasdaq in February, the first China listing since October.", "Bernstein, now 65, has settled on a new business target: Southeast Asia. MBP plans to open an office in May in Singapore as a springboard to a growing region that also includes Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. The area is a \u201cvery ignored part of the world,\u201d particularly in the U.S., Bernstein believes. \u201cI think we're at the very, very beginning for them because things are starting to line up.\u201d ", "What\u2019s lining up? For one, GDP growth \u2014 at least as of February, before Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine shocked the world. \u201cOur forecast for developing Asia is that economic growth will be 5.3% in 2022,\u201d Asian Development Bank Chief Economist Albert Park said on February 1. \u201cWe consider this to be a steady recovery from the pandemic and is supported by progress in vaccination rates and control of the Covid-19 disease.\u201d ", "Another potential plus for Singapore, Southeast Asia\u2019s main financial hub, is a diminished interest among foreign businesses in regional financial services rival Hong Kong. According to a survey released by the ", "European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong on Wednesday,", " a quarter of respondents planned to \u201cfully\u201d relocate out of Hong Kong in the next 12 months given current Covid-19 restrictions and 24% plan to move partially. More than 50% said they were having trouble recruiting overseas staff. International investors are also worried about fallout from China\u2019s close relations with Moscow in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, pulling money out of China shares on an \u201cunprecedented\u201d scale since late February, Bloomberg reported today, citing the Institute of International Finance.", "Another advantage for both Singapore and Southeast Asia for Bernstein: his experience with the growing number of SPACs. MBP has worked on \u201cdozens\u201d of SPAC transactions in the U.S. in the past few years, and sees Western capital looking to partner with growth companies in Southeast Asia through SPAC combinations that could trade in New York or Asian exchanges. \u201cYou have (roughly) 500 SPACs out there (in the U.S.), looking for targets and companies of value,\u201d Bernstein said. SPACs and other international investors eying Southeast Asia\u2019s prospects will be ready to offer relatively big amounts of capital that otherwise wouldn\u2019t necessarily be so readily accessible to local entrepreneurs there, he believes. ", "Though Asian bourses have been slower to embrace SPACs than the U.S., Bernstein sees that evolving with improved regulation. \u201cThere's no doubt in my mind that you see both Hong Kong and Singapore recognize the value of a SPAC as a tool to raise capital,\u201d he said. \u201cThe SPAC market in Asia is in its infant stages right now.\u201d ", "Singapore\u2019s potential further stands out for Bernstein because of the long experience and international ties of the Singapore Exchange, and openness of Singapore to business immigrants. The top 10 richest on the 2021 Forbes Billionaires List with Singaporean citizenship is dotted with members from Greater China, including Zhang Yong, chairman of restaurant chain Haidilao; Li Xiting, chairman of Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics; Forrest Li, founder of e-commerce firm Sea, Shu Ping, co-founder of Haidilao; and Jason Chang, chairman of Advanced Semiconductor Engineering.", "Bernstein also sees in Singapore a technology center with potential akin to Israel, with its own homegrown talent and the ability to attract outsiders to its shores. Singapore-headquartered ride-hailing firm Grab, for instance, debuted on the Nasdaq in December after it merged with Altimeter Growth in the biggest Southeast Asia listing and SPAC deal thus far. That listing has been a disaster for investors so far, losing more than 70% of its value since.", "Beyond tech, companies that cater to consumers with rising disposable income will also appeal to Western stock investors, he believes. \u201cWhen somebody that's making $4,000 a year doubles their income, 100 % of that goes back into the economy.\u201d Indonesia, based on its large population of more than 275 million, is \u201cby far and away number one, putting aside Singapore\u201d in growth potential for MBP, he believes, followed by the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.", "What\u2019s ahead for China\u2019s overseas listings? China\u2019s recent push to encourage income redistribution though a \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d push, may limit the country\u2019s appeal to entrepreneurs if carried too far, Bernstein believes. Limitations on \u201cwho\u201d can succeed, \u201chow much\u201d they can make, and global information flows may be \u201ca challenging effort\u201d for planners looking to grow the economy in the long term, he said.", "Regulatory uncertainties in both the U.S. and China in the meantime are slowing down overseas listings by Chinese companies. \u201cBoth the U.S. and China have laid down rules and the market is unclear how the rules are going to get enforced,\u201d he said. Those include thresholds for government review by China and for accounting disclosure requirements by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cIn a way, the markets are going to compel people to lay down clear rules,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cOne thing I'm sure about China is they've always been super clear on what they want to do and incredibly hazy on the details of how it gets done. And this is no different.\u201d", "Eventually, however, the U.S. and China sides will come together to agreed accounting rules to facilitate listings, he predicts. \u201cI describe China and the U.S. as in 50-year marriage, which that's exactly what it's been. And in a 50-year marriage, there's some very good times and some very bad times. But at the end of the day, as I always say, the reason nobody got divorced is because they couldn't afford it.\u201d", "MBP, though smaller than the accounting big four \u2013 Deloitte, Pricewaterhouse, EY and KPMG, believes its long experience with U.S. listings by China companies offers customer value in Southeast Asia for local businesses looking for international capital, Western investors looking for businesses to put money into, and even mainland Chinese businesses looking to expand into the region. ", "\u201cWhen I go into a market, I only go into the market because I feel that I can add value. I'm not going there to do the same thing everybody else is doing. I'm going to do it better and come out on top, because every time you do that, the only thing that happens is you wind up in the middle of the pack.\u201d", "Visiting Singapore recently, he said he felt much like he was in China two decades ago. \u201cWhen I started in China 20 years ago, I was looking out the window, and I didn't know where anything was. I had no employees there. I had my cell phone. I don't know where the business was going to come from \u2014 even today.\u201d", "And so, he continued, \u201cThis is where things seem to be pointing to,\u201d in Southeast Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s not that (Southeast Asia) is going replace China. Nothing's going to replace China, because nothing has the size and scope and depth of China.

Here are the steps I took to make it happen and how you can, too:", "1. Figure out what this looks like with your current business model.", "One of the biggest challenges most people have in implementing something new is that they feel like it means having to change everything about what they\u2019re currently doing, and that\u2019s almost never true.

If I had to do it over, I\u2019d not only give myself the 30 days, but potentially even longer, as I believe this helped us tremendously. ", "4. Create value and utility behind the NFT.", "I sell a service in my business, so it would make no sense to sell an NFT that isn\u2019t backed by the value of the service and the utility of it. I knew I had value not only in the coaching spot, but in the ample waitlist of people interested in it, so I used the NFT as an opportunity to utilize that.", "That meant that whether someone purchased because they wanted to be able to use that service and skip the waitlist or because they wanted to sell or lease it, they could see the value behind it.

The gains in Xpeng come amid a broader rally in American depositary receipts of Chinese companies after a report in the Chinese state media indicated that the government would support overseas listings, with regulators from the U.S. and China progressing toward a cooperation plan. Chinese ADRs have faced considerable pressure in recent months, amid regulatory and delisting concerns in the U.S and the news is likely helping sentiment. Separately, there are a couple of factors specific to Xpeng that have helped its stock as well. The company raised prices on its vehicles by between 10,100 yuan (about $1,580) to 20,000 yuan (about $3,140) before subsidies last week. The move indicates the company\u2019s strong pricing power and could likely help to maintain margins as costs of components and raw materials surge.

We think it is. Even after last week\u2019s rally, Xpeng stock remains down by about 42% year-to-date presenting a decent entry point. The stock also trades at just about 3.8x consensus 2022 revenue, which is well below EV bellwether Tesla, which trades at almost 12x 2022 consensus revenue. Now the outlook for Xpeng\u2019s business actually appears pretty strong. Consensus estimates for Xpeng\u2019s revenue project roughly 100% growth this year. The longer-term picture also looks positive given strong overall EV demand and favorable regulation in China. EV sales in China, including plug-in hybrids, rose by about 170% in 2021 to close to 3 million units, and EV penetration as a percentage of new-car sales in China stood at approximately 15% last year and this number is only poised to grow.

They lose sight of a crucial aspect of the transaction, which is the customer base they are acquiring. Those customers may not be happy, and many may not stick around.", "Despite clear risks, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) never seems to go out of fashion. Deal-making is elemental to business: strategic, bold, a match of wits, an outcome measured in dollar signs, market share and egos. There\u2019s no quicker way to vanquish a competitor. No wonder M&A gets plenty of headlines, and no wonder CEOs blunder into acquisitions they should avoid.", "Plenty of times we\u2019ve warned clients they were about to take too big a risk on an acquisition, and sometimes they\u2019ve listened. Often they didn\u2019t\u2014but that usually happens once. They decided their assessment of financial statements plus gut instinct told them all they needed to know.", "A year or two later, chagrined by the failure but willing to try it again, they become more receptive to advice. Or at least they are compelled by their lenders to accept our due diligence report. This scenario is more common in private equity circles these days because deal prices have skyrocketed, often necessitating more debt financing. Lenders want assurances they\u2019ll get their money back, so they require more vetting.", "The weak point in these transactions is the acquirer, without knowing the customer base, is about to change the way the business operates. Introducing synergies means a new, leaner management team, new systems, maybe higher pricing. The account manager who\u2019s been around for 20 years is gone. The one-hour response time suddenly becomes two days. All this diminishes the stickiness of relationships. It\u2019s entirely possible the customers already were unhappy.

Sometimes they gain the strength to walk away from a bad deal. In 2021, about 15% of the potential deals we looked at were terminated, which is a high percentage given that many companies tend to think that due diligence is meant to validate, rather than truly vet, a purchase. Another outcome of proper due diligence is, when appropriate, the deal price gets negotiated downward.", "A third positive scenario also is possible. The deal closes as structured and both sides express satisfaction.

Before introducing new products or services, they first become the market share leader in their core business.

Companies can add $1 million in revenue with 1,000 customers or with one customer, depending on the needs of the customers.

Now, it will try to conquer another continent. ", "The Swedish investor agreed today to acquire Baring Private Equity Asia for $7.5 billion, a rare example of one private equity firm buying another that demonstrates the breadth of EQT\u2019s global ambitions. Based in Hong Kong, BPEA is a major player in its namesake region, with a two-decade history of deals and $19.5 billion in assets. The acquisition will take EQT\u2019s total assets under management to about $100 billion, trailing only CVC Capital Partners among Europe-based firms.", "This is the latest step in an expansion plan that EQT has accelerated since it went public in 2019. Asia has recently emerged as a private equity hot spot, with overall M&A activity in the region up nearly 50% last year, per Refinitiv. When EQT surveyed the scene, it decided that buying another investor would be the best way to quickly grow its footprint. ", "\u201cWe realized for us to be able to build that scale organically in Asia would probably take another 10 years,\u201d says Christian Sinding, the CEO of EQT.", "BPEA was a perfect fit. There was clear sector overlap, Sinding says, with both firms focusing on technology, healthcare, services and industrial tech. EQT was also drawn by BPEA\u2019s long track record and fundraising prowess, including a $6.5 billion flagship vehicle that closed in 2020. ", "EQT\u2019s past few years have been defined by growth. With its IPO, EQT became the first major private equity firm in many years to tap the public markets. The gamble is paying off. Since then, its stock price is up some 288%, taking its market cap to about $34 billion\u2014roughly double that of The Carlyle Group, and only a few billion shy of Apollo Global Management. And BPEA is the latest (and largest) in a recent line of acquisitions. Last January, EQT agreed to buy Exeter Property Group for nearly $1.9 billion, adding a real estate investment manager with $10 billion in assets. In November, it agreed to pay as much as $525 million for LSP, a venture firm focused on staking healthcare startups", "All that growth allows EQT to diversify its bets. It helps the firm innovate. And it also positions the firm to build out its retail business, a sector that many private equity experts have identified as the industry\u2019s next great fundraising frontier. ", "\u201cThe increased scale, it really gives us capabilities to continue to stay ahead of the curve in thematic investing, in digital capabilities, AI, sustainability\u2014whatever is needed to really improve the companies and the assets deeply,\u201d Sinding says. \u201cAnd also to build scale toward a global brand, as the private wealth channel, for example, becomes very important. In the next 10 years, a huge amount of capital is coming from private wealth into private equity\u2014we know this very well.\u201d ", "Going public was another way to build a global brand. And EQT\u2019s status as a public company was crucial to being able to pull off the BPEA deal.", "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been possible without being public,\u201d Sinding says. \u201cBeing public gives us a currency. It gives us a stronger balance sheet, so we can actually support these new initiatives.\u201d", "Unlike firms such as Carlyle and Apollo, which have embraced the ongoing boom in private credit, EQT focuses almost exclusively on active ownership strategies where it owns direct stakes in company. EQT says today\u2019s purchase will make it the third-biggest player in the global active investment space, trailing Blackstone and KKR. ", "EQT plans to convert BPEA into an Asian analog for its existing European and North American operations. Jean Salata, the longtime CEO of BPEA, will join EQT as the head of its overall Asia business, which will now operate as BPEA EQT Asia.

Indeed, the story of The DAO and the six-year quest to identify the hacker, shows a lot about just how far the crypto world and the technology for tracking transactions have both come since the first crypto craze. Today, blockchain technology has gone mainstream. But as new applications arise, one of the first uses of crypto\u2014as an anonymity shield\u2014is in retreat, thanks to both regulatory pressure and the fact that transactions on public blockchains are traceable.", "Since Hoenisch won\u2019t talk to me, I can only speculate about his possible motives; back in 2016 he identified technical vulnerabilities in the DAO early and may have decided to strike after concluding his warnings weren\u2019t being taken seriously enough by the creators of the DAO. (One of his TenX cofounders, Julian Hosp, an Austrian medical doctor who now works in blockchain full time, says of Hoenisch: \u201cHe is a person that is ", "super", " opinionated.

Always.\u201d) Looked at from that perspective, this is also a tale of the big brains and big egos that drive the crypto world\u2013and of a hacker who may have justified his actions by telling himself he simply did what the faulty code baked into The DAO allowed him to do.

It had been created by a company named Slock.it, which, instead of seeking traditional venture capital, had decided to create this DAO and then open it up for crowdfunding\u2014with the expectation that its own project would be one of those funded by The DAO. Slock.it\u2019s team thought The DAO might attract $5 million.", "Yet when the crowd sale opened on April 30", "th", ", it took in $9 million in just the first two days, with participants exchanging one ether for 100 DAO tokens. As the money poured in, some on the team felt queasy, but it was too late to cap the sale.\u00a0By the time the funding closed a month later, 15,000 to 20,000 individuals had contributed, The DAO held what was then 15% of all ether and the price of the cryptocurrency was steadily rising. At the same time, a variety of security and structural concerns were being raised about The DAO, including one that would, ironically, later prove to be crucial to limiting the hacker\u2019s immediate access to the spoils. That problem: withdrawing funds was too hard. Someone wanting to retrieve their money had to first create a \u201cchild DAO\u201d or \u201csplit DAO,\u201d which required not only a high degree of technical knowledge, but also waiting periods after each step and the agreement of anyone else who moved funds into that child DAO.", "On the morning of June 17th, ETH reached a new all-time high of $21.52, making the crypto in The DAO worth $249.6 million.

After the hard fork on July 20th, the old blockchain began trading as ether classic (ETC). ", "Soon, the Ethereum community pinpointed the vulnerability that enabled this theft: the DAO smart contract had been written so that any time someone withdrew money, the smart contract would send the money first, before updating that person\u2019s balance. The attacker had used a malicious smart contract that withdrew money (258 ETH at a time), then interfered with the updating of the contract, allowing them to withdraw the same ether again and again. It was as if the attacker had $101 in their bank account, withdrew $100 at a bank, then kept the bank teller from updating the balance to $1, and again requested and received another $100.", "Even worse, once the vulnerability became public, the remaining 7.3 million ETH in The DAO was at risk of a copycat attack. A team of white hat hackers (that is, hackers acting ethically)\u00a0formed and used the attacker\u2019s method to divert the remaining funds into a new child DAO.\u00a0But the attacker still had about 5% of all outstanding ETH, and even the rescued ether was vulnerable, given the flaws in The DAO.

Because ShapeShift didn\u2019t at that time take personally identifying information, the attacker\u2019s identity was not known even though all their blockchain movements were visible. Over the next two months, the hacker managed to obtain 282 bitcoins (then worth $232,000, now more than $11 million).

In the two-week old tweet, Buterin had said that he\u2019d been buying DAO tokens since the security news. Over the following weeks, Hoenisch tweeted anti-hard fork posts like one titled, \u201cToo Big to Fail is Failure Guaranteed.\u201d ", "Curiously, on July 5, a couple weeks after the attack, Hoenisch and Karapetsas exchanged Reddit DMs titled \u201cDarkDAO counter attack\u201d \u2014 though the substance of the messages is unclear because Hoensich has deleted all his Reddit posts. (Hosp recalls that Hoenisch told him he had deleted his Reddit account after an altercation with an \u201cidiot\u201d on Reddit over The DAO.) Hoenisch wrote, \u201cSorry for not contacting first. I got carried away from finding it and telling the community that there is a way to fight back. In any case, I don't see any way the attacker can use this.\u201d", "After Karapetsas told Hoenisch of the white hats\u2019 plans to protect what was left in The DAO, Hoenisch replied, \u201cI took down the post.\u201d Karapetsas responded, \u201cI will keep you up to date with what we do from now on.\u201d Hoenisch\u2019s last message in that exchange: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I messed up the plan.\u201d", "On July 24th, the day after the Ethereum Classic chain revived and began trading on Poloniex, Hoenisch tweeted, \u201cethereum drama escalating: from #daowars to #chainwars. Ethereum classic now traded on poloniex as $ETC and miners planning attacks.\u201d On July 26th, he retweeted Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of the powerful and well-respected Digital Currency Group, who had tweeted, \u201cBought my first non-bitcoin digital currency\u2026Ethereum Classic (ETC).\u201d", "Upon hearing the name Toby Hoenisch, without knowing evidence indicated he was the DAO attacker, Karapetsas, a usually good-humored Greek software developer who was one of the DAO creators and had engaged with him by email and on Reddit, said: \u201cHe was obnoxious\u2026. he was quite insistent on having found a lot of problems.\u201d After hearing that the DarkDAO ETC had been cashed out to a Grin node with Hoenisch\u2019s alias, Karapetsas observed that if Hoenisch had instead remedied the situation while the DarkDao funds were frozen, the Ethereum community would have given him \u201chuge kudos'' for finding the weakness and then returning the ETH. Similarly, Griff Green, whose current projects lean towards helping non-profit and public causes grow in the digital world, believes the hacker missed the chance to \u201cbe a hero.\u201d Says Green: \u201cHe really screwed the pooch...Reputation is way more valuable than money.\u201d", "Ironically, in a 2016 blog post, Hoenisch wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a white hat hacker by heart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0Twenty days later came the DAO attack.", "As I noted earlier,\u00a0after being sent a document laying out the evidence that he was the hacker and asking for comment for my book, Hoenisch wrote that my conclusion is \u201cfactually inaccurate.\u201d He said in that email he could give me more details\u2014and then did not respond to four requests for those details, nor to additional fact checking queries for this article.\u00a0In addition, after receiving the first document detailing the facts I\u2019d gathered, he deleted almost all his Twitter history (though I\u2019ve saved the relevant tweets).

And yes, legal is the main reason we can\u2019t just ship it.\u201d A ", "Bitcoin Magazine ", "article at the time said Hoenisch had a background in AI, IT security and cryptography.", "In early 2017, just months after the presumed DAO attacker stopped trying to cash out their ETC, Hoenisch\u2019s team\u2014by then operating as TenX\u2014announced it had received $1 million in seed funding from (among others) Fenbushi Capital, where Ethereum founder Buterin was a general partner. Then came the $80 million ICO. In early 2018, things started to go south for TenX when its card issuer, Wavecrest, was booted from the Visa network, meaning that TenX's users could no longer use their debit cards. ", "On Oct. 1, 2020, TenX announced it was sunsetting its services because its new card issuer, Wirecard SG, had been directed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to cease operations.\u00a0On April 9, 2021, TenX posted a blog called \u201cTenX, Meet Mimo.\u201d It outlined a new business that would offer a euro-pegged stablecoin, which kept its value pegged to a fiat currency such as US dollars or euros or Japanese Yen. The market cap of TenX tokens, which spiked at $535 million, now sits at just $11 million. TenX has rebranded itself as Mimo Capital and is offering holders of TenX tokens mostly worthless MIMO tokens instead at a rate of 0.37 MIMO for each TenX.", "Hosp, who was the public face of the company while there, was booted by Hoenisch and another cofounder in January 2019. This occurred a couple months after some crypto publications reported on Hosp\u2019s past affiliation with an Austrian multi-level marketing scheme. However, before hearing that evidence indicated Hoenisch was the DAO attacker, Hosp said his feeling had been that Hoenisch had perhaps pushed him out over jealousy that Hosp had sold bitcoin at the top of the bubble in late 2017, netting himself $20 million. Meanwhile, Hoenisch had kept all his crypto as the bubble \u2013 and his personal net worth \u2013 deflated. ", "\u201cHe came from a very poor family, he had no experience in investing, and he was in crypto in 2010 but he had literally no money, nothing, when we were in Las Vegas together [in the summer of 2016] he had nothing, and I was doing really well with my investments\u2026 he would always push for getting more salary, for having something nicer.\u201d Hosp also mentioned Hoenisch had to send money home to his mother, who had raised him, as well as his sister and brother, as a single parent.", "Upon hearing that Hoenisch was the likely DAO attacker, Hosp said he was \u201cgetting goose bumps\u201d and begin recalling details from his interactions with his former partner that now seemed to take on new significance.\u00a0For example, when asked if Hoenisch was into Grin (the privacy coins to which the hacker had cashed out) Hosp said, \u201cYes! Yes, he was. He was fascinated by that\u2026I lost money because of those stupid coins! I invested in them because of him, because he was so fascinated by them.\u201d He said that Hoenisch was also obsessed with building a Bitcoin/Monero \u201catomic swap\u201d \u2013 or a way to use smart contracts to swap between Bitcoin and the privacy coin Monero. At the time, Hosp was confused by that, because he felt there was no market for such a product. Later, Hosp pulled up chats from August 2016, in which Hoenisch seemed excited about the price of ETC, the coin held by the hacker after the ethereum fork. ", "When trying to recall the incident that he believed prompted Hoenisch to close his Reddit, Hosp began searching on his computer and muttered to himself, \u201cHe always used tobyai.\u201d He confirmed that one of Toby\u2019s regular email addresses ended in @toby.ai. ", "Recalled a still astounded Hosp: \u201cFor some weird reason, he was quite well aware of what was happening\u2026He understood more of the DAO hack when I asked him what had happened\u2026than I had found on the internet or anywhere.\u201d", " ", "MORE FROM FORBES"]},

Furthermore, the SEC does not address issues such as carbon markets, carbon taxes, or ", "carbon capital gains taxes", ", rightly leaving them for legislative debate.", "The SEC\u2019s focus is on information that is material to investors. While accountants have different measures of materiality, for investors, material information is defined as \u201cinformation with a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision.\u201d Reasonable investors are certainly taking climate risks into account. ", "The recent proxy fight at ExxonMobil", " is just one example. ", "So, if climate risks are in fact material to investors, what other choices does the SEC have than to regulate their disclosure? Not many, and each has clear drawbacks.", "One choice would be to maintain the status quo, with companies deciding for themselves what climate-related information to disclose. Today, disclosures vary from company to company with a pervasive lack of consistent, comparable and decision useful disclosures. Furthermore, since the advent of Regulation FD (\u201cFair Disclosure\u201d), the SEC has worked hard to avoid \u201cselective disclosure,\u201d and it does not look kindly on companies who share material information with some and not others. Letting the companies decide what climate information they disclose to whom is untenable as climate change is increasingly material.", "Another choice would be for the SEC to discourage companies from making projections or estimates around climate risk. Given that the effects of climate change are in some way contingent and certainly estimated, one could argue that they have no place in company disclosures. Having companies be silent on forward looking climate information may be fine for day-traders or very short-term holders, but it makes no sense for investors who plan to hold the stock for many years and will experience the effects of climate change and the company\u2019s response to it. Sophisticated investors will find other means of projecting the impact of climate on particular companies, but this approach deprives retail investors of that information and means it is not subject to board discussion.", "A third choice would be for the SEC to enact a policy more in line with the new ", "International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) climate-related disclosures prototype", ". There is a strong argument for a global standard, but the SEC instead chose a more limited, investor materiality-focused approach that, like the ISSB, builds on the work of the ", "Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosur", "es.", "Investors make their decisions based on both company-disclosed information and on external data such as competitor information, market intelligence, or economic trends. And although projected future performance tends to drive stock prices, comparable company-disclosed historical data is critical for investors. They will continue to look for externally generated climate risk information \u2013 keeping an eye on the weather, so to speak. But, under the SEC\u2019s proposed rule, they will also be able to base their engagement with investee companies on the companies\u2019 own disclosures.", "The bottom line is that climate risk is investment risk, and it is the SEC\u2019s role to encourage disclosure of material investment risk. The specifics of the rule will be debated and determined over the next few months, but this is information that investors need to know now in order to make calculated decisions for the long term."]},

During most periods of in-school deferment, hardship forbearance, and grace periods (during which no payments are due), interest typically accrues on most types of federal student loans, resulting in borrowers owing much more than what they started with by the time they enter repayment. For borrowers who are repaying their loans under an income-driven repayment plan (where monthly payments are based on the borrower\u2019s income), their normal monthly payment may not be sufficiently high enough to cover interest that accrues in a given month, resulting in the loan balance increasing over time \u2014 even as they make payments.", "To make matters even more troublesome, certain events under federal law can trigger interest \u201ccapitalization\u201d \u2014 a process whereby all of the accrued interest gets added back on to the principal balance.

", "We talked about the status quo in journalism and poor demographic representation in newsrooms, and what it means for media companies and institutions as well as consumers. Diversity of culture, ethnicity, gender, identity and thought are critical in providing content that is fair, balanced and accurate.

Also, as I mentioned on the panel, hiring managers need to look at different types of talent, reprioritizing which skill sets and characteristics are truly merit giving, including people who\u2019ve had to persevere through hardships or nontraditional career histories. These experiences are more likely to net tenacity and endurance than those often lauded as most meritocratic that often boil down to an affinity bias.

Women, non-binary people, and members of other marginalized communities did not create the problems from which they suffer and feel the consequences.

Today he is the world's largest cutter and polisher of the precious gems and a primary source of rough stones to other cutters, polishers and jewelry makers around the globe. Those who have watched his rise over the last three decades say it was his intense hatred of De Beers that fueled him. He bristled under the Syndicate's high-handed treatment of buyers, who were given boxes of rough diamonds at take-it-or-leave-it prices and risked being permanently cut off if they balked.", "Leviev won't openly criticize his former South African business partner. But his defiance seems thinly disguised. \"I'm not going to let anyone else tell me how to run my business,\" he says. \"I grew up in the Soviet Union. I knew what it was to be afraid. I can remember being beaten regularly by the bullies at school, and I said to myself I would never be afraid of anybody or anything again.\"", "Indeed, he has taken significant business away from De Beers in Russia and Angola\u2014two of the world's largest producers of rough diamonds in terms of value. Leviev has not humbled the once-mighty Syndicate alone. But his defiance has inspired others, like Rio Tinto, owner of Australia's Argyle mine, which bypassed De Beers for the first time in 1996 to sell its 42 million carats directly to polishers in Antwerp. In the early 1990s the Russian government began selling some of its rough supply to others, despite its longtime exclusive deal with De Beers. When miners discovered massive diamond reserves in Canada's Northwest Territories, De Beers had to scramble for a piece. Its share of the rough-diamond market, 80% five years ago, has been cut to 60%.", "The reason Leviev is such a threat is that he has profoundly shaken the tradition-bound diamond business. Until recently De Beers had a virtual chokehold on world supplies, determining who could buy uncut stones\u2014and at what quantities and quality\u2014and where the cutting centers were allowed to prosper. Leviev pulled an end run around the cartel, dealing directly with diamond-producing governments and shattering De Beers' all-important relationship with sightholders. He also became the industry's first diamond dealer with his finger on every facet of production, from mining and cutting to polishing and retailing, capturing profits at every stage.", "Trumping De Beers, Leviev has become very rich. He owns 100% of his diamond business, Lev Leviev Group, and a controlling stake in Africa Israel Investments. The latter is a Yehud, Israel-based conglomerate whose holdings include: commercial real estate in Prague and London; Gottex, a swimwear company; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S.; 173 7-Elevens in New Mexico and Texas; a 33% stake in Cross Israel Highway, that nation's first toll road; and an 85% share of Vash Telecanal, Israel's Russian-language TV channel. Leviev also owns a gold mine in Kazakhstan, pieces of two diamond mines in Angola and mining licenses in the Urals and Namibia. He's probably worth $2 billion.", "A part of that wealth comes from exploiting political connections\u2014which has created enmity and suspicion. A recent example: When Leviev was preparing a bid for 40% of Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the banks supporting him pulled out at the last moment. Sources say it was a lack of transparency in Leviev's business. Even if his hands are clean, Leviev has dealt with people whose mitts are dirty. His ubiquitous brigade of burly armed guards isn't just for show.", "Some of Russia's Jewish establishment resent Leviev's pushing his own brand of Hasidism. He has drawn fire for seeing to it that a Lubavitch rabbi, born in Italy and educated in America, was granted citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Leviev installed him as the country's chief rabbi, though the nation already had one. He's playing with fire, critics say, by aligning himself so closely with Putin. Should the president turn on him, Leviev's Jewish activities could be seen as violating the promise Russia's oligarchs made to Putin to stay out of politics in order to keep their assets\u2014many of which were notoriously acquired in the early 1990s.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. Leviev has also become something of a go-to guy between Israel and central Asian countries, enlisting the secular regimes in those mainly Islamic states in the fight against fundamentalist terror groups. Leviev, who now lives in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Israel, is a close associate of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the presidents of Kazakhstan and his native Uzbekistan. Among his pals in Africa are presidents Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia.", "Leviev grew up in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Though under communism his family was committed to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, and all the males, Leviev included, learned to perform ritual circumcisions in secret. Leviev's father Avner was a successful textile merchant and a collector of rare Persian carpets. After seven years of waiting, the family emigrated to Israel in 1971, having converted their wealth into $1 million in rough diamonds, which they smuggled out of the country. But when they tried to unload them in Israel, they were told the diamonds were of inferior quality, worth only $200,000. Leviev, 15 at the time, vowed to right the wrong. Over his father's objections, he left yeshiva and a life of religious education to take up diamond-cutting.", "He opened his own cutting factory in 1977\u2014when speculation in the burgeoning Israeli diamond market went unchecked. Most cutters held inventory, betting on ever-rising prices. When the market collapsed three years later, banks stopped extending credit and many cutters went bust. Leviev hadn't borrowed against his inventory and was in good enough shape to expand to 12 small factories over the next five years. Scrambling to find enough rough diamonds, he flew frequently to London, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Siberia. He also adapted laser technology and acquired cutting software\u2014a revolutionary innovation at the time\u2014to capture more value from his precious supply. Later his cutters could produce digital 3-D models of various diamond cuts, taking into account imperfections, size, weight and shape before touching the stone. \"Part of his genius,\" says Charles Wyndham, cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants and a former director of De Beers' selling arm, \"was marrying cutting-edge technology to exactly what the market wanted.\"", "In 1987 De Beers invited Leviev to become a sightholder, a plum position granted to fewer than 150 people. By then he was one of Israel's largest manufacturers of polished stones. Two years later Russia's state-run diamond mining and selling group, now called Alrosa, asked Leviev to help it set up its own cutting factories\u2014the first time any rough diamonds were finished in the country of their origin\u2014in a joint venture called Ruis. (For decades De Beers has been channeling all rough diamonds through its Diamond Trading Co. in London before reselling them to sightholders at a markup; a diamond mined in, say, Africa traveled halfway around the world before it was resold to a sightholder in Africa.) Today, Leviev owns 100% of Ruis, which cuts $140 million worth of diamonds a year, and polishing operations, including one in Perm, Russia, another in Armenia.", "Leviev horned in on the business by cultivating a cozy relationship with Valery Rudakov, who under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran Alrosa. The partnership opened the Kremlin door for Leviev. \"I never spoke about business with Gorbachev,\" Leviev insists. \"I talked to him about opening Jewish schools where there had been none for 70 years.\" But he probably confirmed Rudakov's suspicions (and those of Gorby) that De Beers was lowballing the country on the value of its gems.", "Leviev's deal gave him a piece of Russia's rough-diamond supply, and gave De Beers fits. By 1995 it had had enough of this upstart and booted him from the sightholders' circle. It is widely believed that Leviev, perhaps anticipating the Syndicate's retaliation, had already secured rough supply from Gokhran, Russia's repository of gems, gold, art and antiques, run by Boris Yeltsin pal Yevgeni Bychkov. The Russian government had decided to unload some of the rough and polished stones it had been accumulating for a long time, probably since 1955\u2014a hoard worth as much as $12 billion in the early 1990s, according to Chaim Even-Zohar, publisher in Ramat Gan, Israel of the influential trade journal ", "Diamond Intelligence Briefs", ". It is widely believed that Leviev became a primary means of liquidating the stockpile. What's more, the stockpile contained some of the most precious stones in the world, 100 carats and larger, says Richard Wake-Walker, a cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants. \"The incredible quality we were seeing couldn't come from a year's mining,\" says Barry Berg, vice president of international sales for William Goldberg Diamond, a Manhattan firm that took advantage of the unparalleled deluge. By 1997 a significant portion of that stockpile was gone.", "Was all that liquidation licit? \"That's what state reserves are for,\" says Rudakov, who is now chairman of a Norilsk Nickel unit. \"When a country is in distress it can sell off those reserves.\"", "Clearly, though, there were less legitimate uses. \"There were one or more Kremlin slush funds, and a variety of questionable benefits were distributed,\" says John Helmer, a veteran U.S. business correspondent in Russia. \"Some of the proceeds went to electioneering, some to offshore accounts and some to individual pockets.\" In 1998 Thomas Kneir, then a deputy assistant director at the FBI, testified before a House banking subcommittee about the smuggling of proceeds from the sale of Russia's state assets, including diamonds, into foreign accounts during the loosey-goosey days of early capitalism. Kneir cited the Golden ADA affair, in which rough diamonds worth $170 million were shipped from Russia to a plant it set up in San Francisco, where they were to be cut and polished. But, says Matthew Hart, author of ", "Diamond", ", the gems and cash disappeared along the way, spent on luxury homes and political payoffs. (Bychkov, charged with abuse of power in connection with Golden ADA, was later pardoned by Yeltsin.)", "If he was the conduit for many transactions, Leviev would have raked it in. \"You buy it today, sell it an hour later and get paid tomorrow,\" explains Manhattan buyer Barry Berg. Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly.", "Whatever he was up to during the Yeltsin years, he kept a low profile. Leviev avoided being identified with the \"Family,\" a group of newly hatched tycoons who tried to convert their economic influence into political power. A smart move, because when Putin became president, he marginalized some Family members, like Boris Berezovsky. Leviev had kept close ties with Putin, brokering meetings for the first time between the new Russian president and prominent Israeli politicos.", "While De Beers struggled in the mid-1990s to deal with Leviev in Russia, it had another problem on its hands closer to home: blood diamonds, the ones that paid for knives and guns. Angola, the world's third-largest producer of rough diamonds, was overrun with rebel forces opposed to President Dos Santos. The rebels took control of the diamond territories and flooded the market with up to $1.2 billion in diamonds a year. De Beers had little choice but to buy the stuff or risk losing its grip on prices, according to the London-based group Global Witness.", "Blood diamonds became a PR migraine for De Beers. In 1998 the United Nations slapped sanctions on the buying of Angolan diamonds from the rebels; a widely circulated report by Global Witness singled out De Beers for \"operat[ing] with an extraordinary lack of accountability.\" Under pressure, the Syndicate closed its buying offices in Angola and the war-pocked Democratic Republic of Congo, while continuing to explore in Angola.", "Leviev had already made a mark in Angola in 1996 when he came through with a $60 million investment, in exchange for 16% of Angola's largest diamond mine, after the government took it back from the rebels. Alrosa, a partner, couldn't come up with the cash. \"Dos Santos said I was the only one who helped his country,\" says Leviev, who guarded his mines with former Israeli intelligence agents. (He and the president bonded, says a report from the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, over their knowledge of Russian and mutual loathing of De Beers.) Leviev also offered to generate more state revenues and promised to cut down on illegal exports. To sweeten the pot, he gave the Angolan government a 51% share of Angola Selling Corp., or Ascorp, the exclusive buyer of Angolan rough diamonds. (Industry insiders whisper that Isabella Dos Santos, the president's daughter, has a separate stake in Ascorp. Leviev says he knows nothing of it.)", "There's more to the story than Leviev cares to discuss. A friend of his, Arcady Gaydamak, an alleged arms dealer with Israeli and Russian citizenship, was an adviser to Dos Santos. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the mid 1990s Gaydamak (wanted in France for illegal arms trafficking) negotiated a forgiveness of Angolan debt to Russia, in exchange for arms. In January 2000, a month after Leviev's Ascorp was awarded the exclusive on Angola's diamonds, Gaydamak bought 15% of Leviev's Africa Israel Investments. Within a year Leviev bought back Gaydamak's stake. A quid pro quo? \"He offered to sell me the shares at a good price,\" says Leviev. \"This was a time before Mr. Gaydamak had legal problems.\" While the two are no longer business associates, they remain chums.", "Leviev apparently delivered on his word to Dos Santos: The government's reported tax collections from diamond sales jumped to $62 million last year from $10 million in 1998. A lot more than that was smuggled out of the country, contends Even-Zohar. Buying up $1 billion worth of Angolan rough diamonds a year strained Leviev, who was under constant pressure to unload the minerals quickly. He couldn't consistently offer miners the best prices. \"So diggers knew they could get far more for their stones, and that led to rampant smuggling,\" says Even-Zohar.", "That may help explain why Leviev lost his Angolan exclusive this summer. When asked about being dropped, Leviev shrugs. \"Don't count me out yet.\"", "He had left a long trail of ill will with De Beers in Angola. In March of 2000 the Syndicate persuaded a Belgian judge to seize a small diamond shipment that turned out to be Leviev's. He successfully petitioned to have the stones returned a few months later. De Beers still contends the 1998 contract with Leviev's Ascorp is invalid and is trying to get its Angolan rights restored and recover $92 million it says it is owed by the Dos Santos government.", "The Syndicate had reason to fight. Ascorp's deal meant that for the first time, De Beers would have had to sell the output of its own mines to someone else\u2014in this case, its archenemy. By May 2001 the company exited Angola entirely.", "Next flashpoint: Namibia, a country rich with diamonds that De Beers has mined since Ernest Oppenheimer bought the concessions after World War I. But like Russia, Namibia wanted to process its own rocks, so in 2000 it forced producers to sell a regular supply of rough diamonds to domestic cutters. De Beers balked, but later relented and built a cutting factory with Namibia\u2014but supplies it with rough from its own London offices.", "Again Leviev exploited the situation. In 2000 he paid $30 million for 37% of Namibian Minerals Corp. (Namco), an offshore diamond mining outfit. As part of the deal, he agreed to open a polishing factory on the Namibian coast. Later, when Namco's mining equipment broke down, Leviev feuded with his partners when they refused to put up more money for repairs. So he got even, forcing the company into bankruptcy, then buying all its mining concessions for a pittance\u2014an estimated $3 million.", "His partnerships in Russia, Angola and Namibia represent part of Leviev's play for direct ownership of rough supplies\u2014geopolitically diversified. He has recently bought a piece of Camafuca in northeast Angola and a diamond exploration licence in Russia's Ural mountains. (Allegedly, he unsuccessfully bid for a piece of Alexkor, South Africa's state-owned diamond mining company. He also failed in an attempt to trade his Namco concessions for a chunk of Trans Hex Group, a publicly traded mining outfit based in Cape Town; one likely stumbling block was his links to Arcady Gaydamak. Leviev denies making either bid.) If Russia's Alrosa, still a state-owned asset, should be privatized, Putin pal Leviev would certainly be on any short list of potential buyers.", "Leviev boasts: \"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" But De Beers has been moving vertically, too. Its loss of market dominance pushed it into the retail end. It formed a joint venture with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, unveiled in 2000, to create an upscale brand that would fetch a premium over unbranded diamonds. Each partner put up $200 million, hoping for the kind of margins that would compensate for the loss of share in the mining side of the business. But so far, all it's done is create collateral damage. In July De Beers dropped 35 of its 120 longtime sightholders (adding 10 new ones), raising rampant speculation that it was keeping its best supplies for its retail operation. De Beers vigorously denies this and says it cut the sightholders following its \"objective [review] process.\" (Still, the move created quite a stir in Manhattan's 47th Street Diamond District; see sidebar above).", "De Beers LV, as the partnership is known, hasn't made the expected splash. So far there's just one stand-alone store, on London's Bond Street. A planned Madison Avenue store has been delayed indefinitely.", "Still, the De Beers-driven branding trend has caught fire. Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with fashion house Escada to create the 12-sided \"Escada cut\" for its signature jewelry line. Leo Schachter Diamonds, a Tel Aviv-based sightholder, spent at least $5 million to advertise its 66-faceted Leo diamond in magazines like ", "People", " and ", "Vanity Fair", ". While Tiffany patented the Lucida diamond, a 50-facet square cut, New York's William Goldberg produced the antique-looking Ashoka variety. Even Leviev is launching his own high-end jewelry line, dubbed the Vivid Collection, hoarding his best stones for pieces priced from $50,000 to a few million dollars.", "Leviev is also moving beyond the ancient game of one-upmanship\u2014and beyond the dirty business of diamonds. You see it in his latest investments. With partners, he's financing $1 billion in real estate development in Russia over the next four years, including three office buildings in central Moscow, and expects to put up a similar amount for office and residential complexes in New York City, Dallas and San Antonio. You can also see it in his political activities. In June he brokered a meeting in Moscow between Putin and American Jewish leaders, including James Tisch, chief executive of Loews Corp., to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.", "Perhaps his religious philanthropy is his ultimate reach for legitimacy. Lately he has expanded his Chabad initiatives, once confined to Russia and other former Soviet republics, to the West. This year he is setting up a school in Dresden to teach nonreligious Jewish emigres about the faith. Last year he opened a new school in Queens, N.Y. that caters to 350 Jewish students whose families formerly lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. \"It's about staying true to the legacy of my father,\" he says. \"All I want is for people in these places to know they are Jewish.\" A moment later he is whisked through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where a caravan of heavily guarded SUVs awaits.", "MORE FROM FORBES"]},

Its creator, Vitalik Buterin, has more than 3 million Twitter followers, has made videos with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, and has met with Vladimir Putin. All the most popular trends in crypto over the last several years launched on Ethereum: initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). And it has spawned a whole class of blockchain imitators, often called \u201cEthereum killers.\u201d", "Ethereum is also the subject of a great mystery: who committed the largest theft of ether (Ethereum\u2019s native token) ever, by hacking The DAO? The decentralized venture capital fund had raised $139 million in ether (ETH) by the time its crowd sale ended in 2016, making it the most successful crowdfunding effort to that date.\u00a0Weeks later, a hacker siphoned 31% of the ETH in The DAO\u20143.64 million total or about 5% of all ETH then outstanding\u2014out of the main DAO and into what became known as the DarkDAO.", "Who hacked The DAO? My exclusive investigation, built on the reporting for my new book, ", "The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze", ", ", "appears to point to Toby Hoenisch,\u00a0a 36-year-old programmer who grew up in Austria and was living in Singapore at the time of the hack. Until now, he has been best known for his role as a cofounder and CEO of TenX, which raised $80 million in a 2017 initial coin offering to build a crypto debit card\u2014an effort that failed.\u00a0The market cap of those tokens, which spiked at $535 million, now sits at just $11 million. ", "After being sent a document detailing the evidence pointing to him as the hacker, Hoenisch wrote in an email, \u201cYour statement and conclusion is factually inaccurate.\u201d\u00a0In that email, Hoenisch offered to provide details refuting our findings\u2014but never answered my repeated follow-up messages to him asking for those details.", "To put the enormity of this hack in perspective, with ETH now trading around $3,000, 3.64 million ETH would be worth $11 billion. The DAO theft famously and controversially prompted Ethereum to do a hard fork\u2014where the Ethereum network split into two as a way to restore the stolen funds\u2014which ultimately left the DarkDAO holding not ETH, but far less valuable Ethereum Classic (ETC). The proponents of the fork had hoped ETC would die out, but it now trades around $30. That means the descendant wallets of the DarkDAO\u00a0now hold more than $100 million in ETC\u2014a high dollar monument to the biggest whodunnit in crypto.", "Last year, as I was working on my book, my sources and I, utilizing (among other things), a powerful and previously secret forensics tool from crypto tracing firm Chainalysis, came to believe we had figured out who did it. Indeed, the story of The DAO and the six-year quest to identify the hacker, shows a lot about just how far the crypto world and the technology for tracking transactions have both come since the first crypto craze. Today, blockchain technology has gone mainstream. But as new applications arise, one of the first uses of crypto\u2014as an anonymity shield\u2014is in retreat, thanks to both regulatory pressure and the fact that transactions on public blockchains are traceable.", "Since Hoenisch won\u2019t talk to me, I can only speculate about his possible motives; back in 2016 he identified technical vulnerabilities in the DAO early and may have decided to strike after concluding his warnings weren\u2019t being taken seriously enough by the creators of the DAO. (One of his TenX cofounders, Julian Hosp, an Austrian medical doctor who now works in blockchain full time, says of Hoenisch: \u201cHe is a person that is ", "super", " opinionated. Always believed he was right. Always.\u201d) Looked at from that perspective, this is also a tale of the big brains and big egos that drive the crypto world\u2013and of a hacker who may have justified his actions by telling himself he simply did what the faulty code baked into The DAO allowed him to do. ", "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", "I", "n early 2016, the Ethereum network was not even a year old, and there was only one app on it that people were interested in: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund built with a smart contract that gave its token holders the right to vote on proposals submitted for funding. It had been created by a company named Slock.it, which, instead of seeking traditional venture capital, had decided to create this DAO and then open it up for crowdfunding\u2014with the expectation that its own project would be one of those funded by The DAO. Slock.it\u2019s team thought The DAO might attract $5 million.", "Yet when the crowd sale opened on April 30", "th", ", it took in $9 million in just the first two days, with participants exchanging one ether for 100 DAO tokens. As the money poured in, some on the team felt queasy, but it was too late to cap the sale.\u00a0By the time the funding closed a month later, 15,000 to 20,000 individuals had contributed, The DAO held what was then 15% of all ether and the price of the cryptocurrency was steadily rising. At the same time, a variety of security and structural concerns were being raised about The DAO, including one that would, ironically, later prove to be crucial to limiting the hacker\u2019s immediate access to the spoils. That problem: withdrawing funds was too hard. Someone wanting to retrieve their money had to first create a \u201cchild DAO\u201d or \u201csplit DAO,\u201d which required not only a high degree of technical knowledge, but also waiting periods after each step and the agreement of anyone else who moved funds into that child DAO.", "On the morning of June 17th, ETH reached a new all-time high of $21.52, making the crypto in The DAO worth $249.6 million. When American Griff Green woke up that morning in Mittweida, Germany (he was staying in the family home of two brothers who were Slock.it cofounders), he had a message on his phone from a DAO Slack community member who said something weird was happening\u2014 it looked like funds were being drained. Green, Slock.it\u2019s first employee and community organizer, checked: there was indeed a stream of 258-ETH (then $5,600) transactions leaving The DAO. ", "\u00a0", "By the time the attack stopped a few hours later, 31% of the ETH in The DAO had been siphoned out into the DarkDAO. As awareness of the attack spread, ether had its highest trading day ever, with its price plummeting 33% from $21 to $14.", "Split Fortunes ", "The 2016 DAO crowdfunding sale drove the price of ether (ETH) to a then record high\u2014until the June 17th attack on The DAO sent it plummeting. After the hard fork on July 20th, the old blockchain began trading as ether classic (ETC). ", "Soon, the Ethereum community pinpointed the vulnerability that enabled this theft: the DAO smart contract had been written so that any time someone withdrew money, the smart contract would send the money first, before updating that person\u2019s balance. The attacker had used a malicious smart contract that withdrew money (258 ETH at a time), then interfered with the updating of the contract, allowing them to withdraw the same ether again and again. It was as if the attacker had $101 in their bank account, withdrew $100 at a bank, then kept the bank teller from updating the balance to $1, and again requested and received another $100.", "Even worse, once the vulnerability became public, the remaining 7.3 million ETH in The DAO was at risk of a copycat attack. A team of white hat hackers (that is, hackers acting ethically)\u00a0formed and used the attacker\u2019s method to divert the remaining funds into a new child DAO.\u00a0But the attacker still had about 5% of all outstanding ETH, and even the rescued ether was vulnerable, given the flaws in The DAO. Plus, the clock was ticking down to a July 21", "st", " deadline\u2014the first date when the original hacker might be able to get at the funds they had diverted into the DarkDao.

(Under the rules of the DAO smart contract, the attacker couldn\u2019t withdraw funds if anyone else in their split DAO objected.) Bottom line: if the white hats ever missed their window to object, the attacker would be able to abscond with the funds\u2014meaning this informal group would have to be constantly vigilant.", "Eventually, after much bickering (on Reddit, on a Slack channel, over email and on Skype calls) and Ethereum founder Buterin publicly weighing in, and after it seemed that a majority of the Ethereum community supported the measure, Ethereum did a \u201chard fork.\u201d On July 20", "th", " the Ethereum blockchain was split into two. All the ETH that had been in the DAO was moved to a \u201cwithdraw\u201d contract which gave the original contributors the right to send in their DAO tokens and get back ETH on the new blockchain.

", "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", "O", "n Ethereum Classic, The DAO and the attacker\u2019s loot (in the form of 3.64 million ETC) remained. That summer, the attacker moved their ETC a few hops away to a new wallet, which remained dormant until late October, when they began trying to use an exchange called ShapeShift to cash the money out to bitcoin. Because ShapeShift didn\u2019t at that time take personally identifying information, the attacker\u2019s identity was not known even though all their blockchain movements were visible. Over the next two months, the hacker managed to obtain 282 bitcoins (then worth $232,000, now more than $11 million). And then, perhaps because ShapeShift frequently blocked their attempted trades, they gave up cashing out, leaving behind 3.4 million Ether Classic (ETC), then worth $3.2 million and now more than $100 million.", "That might have been the end of the story\u2014an unknown hacker sitting on a fortune he couldn\u2019t cash out. Except last July, one of my sources involved in the DAO rescue, a Brazilian named Alex Van de Sande (aka Avsa) reached out, saying the Brazilian Police had opened an investigation into the attack on The DAO \u2014 and whether he might be a victim or even the hacker himself.\u00a0 Van de Sande decided to commission a forensics report from blockchain analytics company Coinfirm to help exonerate himself (though then, the police closed the investigation, he said). In case any similar situations arose in the future, he went forward with the report examining those cash-out attempts in 2016.", "Among the early suspects\u00a0in the hack had been a Swiss businessman and his associates, and in tracing the funds, Van de Sande and I also found another suspect: a Russia-based Ethereum Classic developer. But all these people were in Europe/Russia and the cash-outs mapped onto an Asian-morning-through-evening schedule\u2014from 9 A.M. to midnight Tokyo time\u2014when the Europeans were likely sleeping.

In his email, he said he was writing a proposal for funding from The DAO for a crypto card product called DAO.PAY, and added, \u201cFor our due diligence, we went through the DAO code and found a few things that are worrisome.\u201d He outlined three possible attack vectors and later emailed with a fourth. Jentzsch, a German who had been working on a PhD in physics before dropping out to focus on Ethereum, responded point by point, conceding some of Hoenisch\u2019s assertions but saying others were \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t work.\u201d\u00a0The back and forth ended with Hoenisch writing;\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll keep you in the loop if we find anything else.\u201d", "But instead of further email exchanges, on May 28", "th", ", Hoenish wrote four posts on Medium, beginning with, \u201cTheDAO\u2014risk free voting.\u201d The second, \u201cTheDAO\u2014blackmailing withdrawals,\u201d foreshadowed the main issue with The DAO and why Ethereum ultimately chose to hard fork: if it did not, the only other options were to let the attacker cash out his ill-gotten gains or for some group of DAO token holders to follow him forever into new split DAOs he created as he attempted to cash out. \u201cTLDR: If you end upon in a DAO contract without majority voting power, then an attacker can block all withdrawals indefinitely,\u201d he wrote. The third showed how an attacker could do this cheaply.", "His last, most telling post for the day, \u201cTheDAO\u2014a $150m lesson in decentralized governance,\u201d said DAO.PAY decided against making a proposal after uncovering \u201cmajor security flaws\u201d and that \u201cSlockit down-played the severity of the attack vectors.\u201d He wrote, \u201cTheDAO is live \u2026 and we are still waiting for Slockit to put out a warning that THERE IS NO SAFE WAY TO WITHDRAW!\u201d", "On June 3, his last Medium post, \u201cAnnouncing BlockOps: Blockchain Hack Challenges\u201d said, \u201cBlockOps is your playground to break encryption, steal bitcoin, break smart contracts and simply test your security knowledge.\u201d Although he promised to \u201cpost new challenges in the field of bitcoin, ethereum and web security every 2 weeks,\u201d I could find no record that he did so.", "Two weeks later came the DAO attack. The morning after the attack, at 7:18 A.M. Singapore time, Hoenisch trolled Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin by retweeting something Buterin had said before The DAO was attacked, but after it was known that the vulnerability used in the attack was evident in the DAO\u2019s code. In the two-week old tweet, Buterin had said that he\u2019d been buying DAO tokens since the security news. Over the following weeks, Hoenisch tweeted anti-hard fork posts like one titled, \u201cToo Big to Fail is Failure Guaranteed.\u201d ", "Curiously, on July 5, a couple weeks after the attack, Hoenisch and Karapetsas exchanged Reddit DMs titled \u201cDarkDAO counter attack\u201d \u2014 though the substance of the messages is unclear because Hoensich has deleted all his Reddit posts. (Hosp recalls that Hoenisch told him he had deleted his Reddit account after an altercation with an \u201cidiot\u201d on Reddit over The DAO.) Hoenisch wrote, \u201cSorry for not contacting first.

Yes, he was. He was fascinated by that\u2026I lost money because of those stupid coins!

At the time, Hosp was confused by that, because he felt there was no market for such a product.

During most periods of in-school deferment, hardship forbearance, and grace periods (during which no payments are due), interest typically accrues on most types of federal student loans, resulting in borrowers owing much more than what they started with by the time they enter repayment. For borrowers who are repaying their loans under an income-driven repayment plan (where monthly payments are based on the borrower\u2019s income), their normal monthly payment may not be sufficiently high enough to cover interest that accrues in a given month, resulting in the loan balance increasing over time \u2014 even as they make payments.", "To make matters even more troublesome, certain events under federal law can trigger interest \u201ccapitalization\u201d \u2014 a process whereby all of the accrued interest gets added back on to the principal balance.

Diversity of culture, ethnicity, gender, identity and thought are critical in providing content that is fair, balanced and accurate.

This critical lack of representation leads to other issues like consumer mistrust and biased reporting.

Lasting and measurable change comes from the top. As the media industry diversifies, so should the power behind it.", "The DEI problems in tech present different challenges but have similar roots to those in the media industry. Technology developed solely by cisgeneder white men (the largest demographic in tech) generally cannot efficiently identify and address the specific needs of those outside of their demo or psychographics. People cannot solve for what they don\u2019t know and what they don\u2019t listen to. The rallying cry to diversify tech has been sounding for years and it is time for leaders to stop, listen, learn and act.

Also, as I mentioned on the panel, hiring managers need to look at different types of talent, reprioritizing which skill sets and characteristics are truly merit giving, including people who\u2019ve had to persevere through hardships or nontraditional career histories. These experiences are more likely to net tenacity and endurance than those often lauded as most meritocratic that often boil down to an affinity bias. Those potential team members are usually better equipped, given the right culture, to handle the high pressures of a job in one of these fast-paced environs. It\u2019s not enough that these people are then employed; they must be retained and promoted. ", "We also need to hold companies and leaders accountable for promises made in the distant and immediate past during the racial uprisings of 2020.

I\u2019ll go a step further and say that it is the responsibility of tech and media titans to institute this change. Women, non-binary people, and members of other marginalized communities did not create the problems from which they suffer and feel the consequences. Doing the often free work of leading the DEI charge for institutions that consistently deny your humanity and question your talent requires mental, emotional and physical labor that many of us are tired of doing.

He restored this town's only remaining synagogue, which the Nazis had turned into an arms depot and communists converted to a cinema. Now a ragtag klezmer band serenades him as photographers snap pictures and boys perform a traditional Hasidic dance in his honor. Across some 400 villages in Russia and the former Soviet republics this scene has been replayed countless times. Leviev is a 47-year-old, Uzbeki-born Israeli citizen and devout Lubavitcher who gives away at least $30 million a year in order to return lost Jews to the flock.", "This little-known billionaire is also the scourge of De Beers, the giant miner and marketer of diamonds, known as the \"Syndicate.\" Leviev was once a sightholder, one of a few exclusive direct buyers of De Beers rough diamonds. Today he is the world's largest cutter and polisher of the precious gems and a primary source of rough stones to other cutters, polishers and jewelry makers around the globe. Those who have watched his rise over the last three decades say it was his intense hatred of De Beers that fueled him. He bristled under the Syndicate's high-handed treatment of buyers, who were given boxes of rough diamonds at take-it-or-leave-it prices and risked being permanently cut off if they balked.", "Leviev won't openly criticize his former South African business partner. But his defiance seems thinly disguised. \"I'm not going to let anyone else tell me how to run my business,\" he says. \"I grew up in the Soviet Union. I knew what it was to be afraid. I can remember being beaten regularly by the bullies at school, and I said to myself I would never be afraid of anybody or anything again.\"", "Indeed, he has taken significant business away from De Beers in Russia and Angola\u2014two of the world's largest producers of rough diamonds in terms of value. Leviev has not humbled the once-mighty Syndicate alone. But his defiance has inspired others, like Rio Tinto, owner of Australia's Argyle mine, which bypassed De Beers for the first time in 1996 to sell its 42 million carats directly to polishers in Antwerp. In the early 1990s the Russian government began selling some of its rough supply to others, despite its longtime exclusive deal with De Beers. When miners discovered massive diamond reserves in Canada's Northwest Territories, De Beers had to scramble for a piece. Its share of the rough-diamond market, 80% five years ago, has been cut to 60%.", "The reason Leviev is such a threat is that he has profoundly shaken the tradition-bound diamond business. Until recently De Beers had a virtual chokehold on world supplies, determining who could buy uncut stones\u2014and at what quantities and quality\u2014and where the cutting centers were allowed to prosper. Leviev pulled an end run around the cartel, dealing directly with diamond-producing governments and shattering De Beers' all-important relationship with sightholders. He also became the industry's first diamond dealer with his finger on every facet of production, from mining and cutting to polishing and retailing, capturing profits at every stage.", "Trumping De Beers, Leviev has become very rich. He owns 100% of his diamond business, Lev Leviev Group, and a controlling stake in Africa Israel Investments. The latter is a Yehud, Israel-based conglomerate whose holdings include: commercial real estate in Prague and London; Gottex, a swimwear company; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S.; 173 7-Elevens in New Mexico and Texas; a 33% stake in Cross Israel Highway, that nation's first toll road; and an 85% share of Vash Telecanal, Israel's Russian-language TV channel. Leviev also owns a gold mine in Kazakhstan, pieces of two diamond mines in Angola and mining licenses in the Urals and Namibia. He's probably worth $2 billion.", "A part of that wealth comes from exploiting political connections\u2014which has created enmity and suspicion. A recent example: When Leviev was preparing a bid for 40% of Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the banks supporting him pulled out at the last moment. Sources say it was a lack of transparency in Leviev's business. Even if his hands are clean, Leviev has dealt with people whose mitts are dirty. His ubiquitous brigade of burly armed guards isn't just for show.", "Some of Russia's Jewish establishment resent Leviev's pushing his own brand of Hasidism. He has drawn fire for seeing to it that a Lubavitch rabbi, born in Italy and educated in America, was granted citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Leviev installed him as the country's chief rabbi, though the nation already had one. He's playing with fire, critics say, by aligning himself so closely with Putin. Should the president turn on him, Leviev's Jewish activities could be seen as violating the promise Russia's oligarchs made to Putin to stay out of politics in order to keep their assets\u2014many of which were notoriously acquired in the early 1990s.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. Leviev has also become something of a go-to guy between Israel and central Asian countries, enlisting the secular regimes in those mainly Islamic states in the fight against fundamentalist terror groups. Leviev, who now lives in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Israel, is a close associate of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the presidents of Kazakhstan and his native Uzbekistan. Among his pals in Africa are presidents Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia.", "Leviev grew up in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Though under communism his family was committed to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, and all the males, Leviev included, learned to perform ritual circumcisions in secret. Leviev's father Avner was a successful textile merchant and a collector of rare Persian carpets. After seven years of waiting, the family emigrated to Israel in 1971, having converted their wealth into $1 million in rough diamonds, which they smuggled out of the country. But when they tried to unload them in Israel, they were told the diamonds were of inferior quality, worth only $200,000. Leviev, 15 at the time, vowed to right the wrong. Over his father's objections, he left yeshiva and a life of religious education to take up diamond-cutting.", "He opened his own cutting factory in 1977\u2014when speculation in the burgeoning Israeli diamond market went unchecked. Most cutters held inventory, betting on ever-rising prices. When the market collapsed three years later, banks stopped extending credit and many cutters went bust. Leviev hadn't borrowed against his inventory and was in good enough shape to expand to 12 small factories over the next five years. Scrambling to find enough rough diamonds, he flew frequently to London, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Siberia. He also adapted laser technology and acquired cutting software\u2014a revolutionary innovation at the time\u2014to capture more value from his precious supply. Later his cutters could produce digital 3-D models of various diamond cuts, taking into account imperfections, size, weight and shape before touching the stone. \"Part of his genius,\" says Charles Wyndham, cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants and a former director of De Beers' selling arm, \"was marrying cutting-edge technology to exactly what the market wanted.\"", "In 1987 De Beers invited Leviev to become a sightholder, a plum position granted to fewer than 150 people. By then he was one of Israel's largest manufacturers of polished stones. Two years later Russia's state-run diamond mining and selling group, now called Alrosa, asked Leviev to help it set up its own cutting factories\u2014the first time any rough diamonds were finished in the country of their origin\u2014in a joint venture called Ruis. (For decades De Beers has been channeling all rough diamonds through its Diamond Trading Co. in London before reselling them to sightholders at a markup; a diamond mined in, say, Africa traveled halfway around the world before it was resold to a sightholder in Africa.) Today, Leviev owns 100% of Ruis, which cuts $140 million worth of diamonds a year, and polishing operations, including one in Perm, Russia, another in Armenia.", "Leviev horned in on the business by cultivating a cozy relationship with Valery Rudakov, who under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran Alrosa. The partnership opened the Kremlin door for Leviev. \"I never spoke about business with Gorbachev,\" Leviev insists. \"I talked to him about opening Jewish schools where there had been none for 70 years.\" But he probably confirmed Rudakov's suspicions (and those of Gorby) that De Beers was lowballing the country on the value of its gems.", "Leviev's deal gave him a piece of Russia's rough-diamond supply, and gave De Beers fits. By 1995 it had had enough of this upstart and booted him from the sightholders' circle. It is widely believed that Leviev, perhaps anticipating the Syndicate's retaliation, had already secured rough supply from Gokhran, Russia's repository of gems, gold, art and antiques, run by Boris Yeltsin pal Yevgeni Bychkov. The Russian government had decided to unload some of the rough and polished stones it had been accumulating for a long time, probably since 1955\u2014a hoard worth as much as $12 billion in the early 1990s, according to Chaim Even-Zohar, publisher in Ramat Gan, Israel of the influential trade journal ", "Diamond Intelligence Briefs", ". It is widely believed that Leviev became a primary means of liquidating the stockpile. What's more, the stockpile contained some of the most precious stones in the world, 100 carats and larger, says Richard Wake-Walker, a cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants. \"The incredible quality we were seeing couldn't come from a year's mining,\" says Barry Berg, vice president of international sales for William Goldberg Diamond, a Manhattan firm that took advantage of the unparalleled deluge. By 1997 a significant portion of that stockpile was gone.", "Was all that liquidation licit? \"That's what state reserves are for,\" says Rudakov, who is now chairman of a Norilsk Nickel unit. \"When a country is in distress it can sell off those reserves.\"", "Clearly, though, there were less legitimate uses. \"There were one or more Kremlin slush funds, and a variety of questionable benefits were distributed,\" says John Helmer, a veteran U.S. business correspondent in Russia. \"Some of the proceeds went to electioneering, some to offshore accounts and some to individual pockets.\" In 1998 Thomas Kneir, then a deputy assistant director at the FBI, testified before a House banking subcommittee about the smuggling of proceeds from the sale of Russia's state assets, including diamonds, into foreign accounts during the loosey-goosey days of early capitalism. Kneir cited the Golden ADA affair, in which rough diamonds worth $170 million were shipped from Russia to a plant it set up in San Francisco, where they were to be cut and polished. But, says Matthew Hart, author of ", "Diamond", ", the gems and cash disappeared along the way, spent on luxury homes and political payoffs. (Bychkov, charged with abuse of power in connection with Golden ADA, was later pardoned by Yeltsin.)", "If he was the conduit for many transactions, Leviev would have raked it in. \"You buy it today, sell it an hour later and get paid tomorrow,\" explains Manhattan buyer Barry Berg. Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly.", "Whatever he was up to during the Yeltsin years, he kept a low profile. Leviev avoided being identified with the \"Family,\" a group of newly hatched tycoons who tried to convert their economic influence into political power. A smart move, because when Putin became president, he marginalized some Family members, like Boris Berezovsky. Leviev had kept close ties with Putin, brokering meetings for the first time between the new Russian president and prominent Israeli politicos.", "While De Beers struggled in the mid-1990s to deal with Leviev in Russia, it had another problem on its hands closer to home: blood diamonds, the ones that paid for knives and guns. Angola, the world's third-largest producer of rough diamonds, was overrun with rebel forces opposed to President Dos Santos. The rebels took control of the diamond territories and flooded the market with up to $1.2 billion in diamonds a year. De Beers had little choice but to buy the stuff or risk losing its grip on prices, according to the London-based group Global Witness.", "Blood diamonds became a PR migraine for De Beers. In 1998 the United Nations slapped sanctions on the buying of Angolan diamonds from the rebels; a widely circulated report by Global Witness singled out De Beers for \"operat[ing] with an extraordinary lack of accountability.\" Under pressure, the Syndicate closed its buying offices in Angola and the war-pocked Democratic Republic of Congo, while continuing to explore in Angola.", "Leviev had already made a mark in Angola in 1996 when he came through with a $60 million investment, in exchange for 16% of Angola's largest diamond mine, after the government took it back from the rebels. Alrosa, a partner, couldn't come up with the cash. \"Dos Santos said I was the only one who helped his country,\" says Leviev, who guarded his mines with former Israeli intelligence agents. (He and the president bonded, says a report from the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, over their knowledge of Russian and mutual loathing of De Beers.) Leviev also offered to generate more state revenues and promised to cut down on illegal exports. To sweeten the pot, he gave the Angolan government a 51% share of Angola Selling Corp., or Ascorp, the exclusive buyer of Angolan rough diamonds. (Industry insiders whisper that Isabella Dos Santos, the president's daughter, has a separate stake in Ascorp. Leviev says he knows nothing of it.)", "There's more to the story than Leviev cares to discuss. A friend of his, Arcady Gaydamak, an alleged arms dealer with Israeli and Russian citizenship, was an adviser to Dos Santos. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the mid 1990s Gaydamak (wanted in France for illegal arms trafficking) negotiated a forgiveness of Angolan debt to Russia, in exchange for arms. In January 2000, a month after Leviev's Ascorp was awarded the exclusive on Angola's diamonds, Gaydamak bought 15% of Leviev's Africa Israel Investments. Within a year Leviev bought back Gaydamak's stake. A quid pro quo? \"He offered to sell me the shares at a good price,\" says Leviev. \"This was a time before Mr. Gaydamak had legal problems.\" While the two are no longer business associates, they remain chums.", "Leviev apparently delivered on his word to Dos Santos: The government's reported tax collections from diamond sales jumped to $62 million last year from $10 million in 1998. A lot more than that was smuggled out of the country, contends Even-Zohar. Buying up $1 billion worth of Angolan rough diamonds a year strained Leviev, who was under constant pressure to unload the minerals quickly. He couldn't consistently offer miners the best prices. \"So diggers knew they could get far more for their stones, and that led to rampant smuggling,\" says Even-Zohar.", "That may help explain why Leviev lost his Angolan exclusive this summer. When asked about being dropped, Leviev shrugs. \"Don't count me out yet.\"", "He had left a long trail of ill will with De Beers in Angola. In March of 2000 the Syndicate persuaded a Belgian judge to seize a small diamond shipment that turned out to be Leviev's. He successfully petitioned to have the stones returned a few months later. De Beers still contends the 1998 contract with Leviev's Ascorp is invalid and is trying to get its Angolan rights restored and recover $92 million it says it is owed by the Dos Santos government.", "The Syndicate had reason to fight. Ascorp's deal meant that for the first time, De Beers would have had to sell the output of its own mines to someone else\u2014in this case, its archenemy. By May 2001 the company exited Angola entirely.", "Next flashpoint: Namibia, a country rich with diamonds that De Beers has mined since Ernest Oppenheimer bought the concessions after World War I. But like Russia, Namibia wanted to process its own rocks, so in 2000 it forced producers to sell a regular supply of rough diamonds to domestic cutters. De Beers balked, but later relented and built a cutting factory with Namibia\u2014but supplies it with rough from its own London offices.", "Again Leviev exploited the situation. In 2000 he paid $30 million for 37% of Namibian Minerals Corp. (Namco), an offshore diamond mining outfit. As part of the deal, he agreed to open a polishing factory on the Namibian coast. Later, when Namco's mining equipment broke down, Leviev feuded with his partners when they refused to put up more money for repairs. So he got even, forcing the company into bankruptcy, then buying all its mining concessions for a pittance\u2014an estimated $3 million.", "His partnerships in Russia, Angola and Namibia represent part of Leviev's play for direct ownership of rough supplies\u2014geopolitically diversified. He has recently bought a piece of Camafuca in northeast Angola and a diamond exploration licence in Russia's Ural mountains. (Allegedly, he unsuccessfully bid for a piece of Alexkor, South Africa's state-owned diamond mining company. He also failed in an attempt to trade his Namco concessions for a chunk of Trans Hex Group, a publicly traded mining outfit based in Cape Town; one likely stumbling block was his links to Arcady Gaydamak. Leviev denies making either bid.) If Russia's Alrosa, still a state-owned asset, should be privatized, Putin pal Leviev would certainly be on any short list of potential buyers.", "Leviev boasts: \"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" But De Beers has been moving vertically, too. Its loss of market dominance pushed it into the retail end. It formed a joint venture with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, unveiled in 2000, to create an upscale brand that would fetch a premium over unbranded diamonds. Each partner put up $200 million, hoping for the kind of margins that would compensate for the loss of share in the mining side of the business. But so far, all it's done is create collateral damage. In July De Beers dropped 35 of its 120 longtime sightholders (adding 10 new ones), raising rampant speculation that it was keeping its best supplies for its retail operation. De Beers vigorously denies this and says it cut the sightholders following its \"objective [review] process.\" (Still, the move created quite a stir in Manhattan's 47th Street Diamond District; see sidebar above).", "De Beers LV, as the partnership is known, hasn't made the expected splash. So far there's just one stand-alone store, on London's Bond Street. A planned Madison Avenue store has been delayed indefinitely.", "Still, the De Beers-driven branding trend has caught fire. Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with fashion house Escada to create the 12-sided \"Escada cut\" for its signature jewelry line. Leo Schachter Diamonds, a Tel Aviv-based sightholder, spent at least $5 million to advertise its 66-faceted Leo diamond in magazines like ", "People", " and ", "Vanity Fair", ". While Tiffany patented the Lucida diamond, a 50-facet square cut, New York's William Goldberg produced the antique-looking Ashoka variety. Even Leviev is launching his own high-end jewelry line, dubbed the Vivid Collection, hoarding his best stones for pieces priced from $50,000 to a few million dollars.", "Leviev is also moving beyond the ancient game of one-upmanship\u2014and beyond the dirty business of diamonds. You see it in his latest investments. With partners, he's financing $1 billion in real estate development in Russia over the next four years, including three office buildings in central Moscow, and expects to put up a similar amount for office and residential complexes in New York City, Dallas and San Antonio. You can also see it in his political activities. In June he brokered a meeting in Moscow between Putin and American Jewish leaders, including James Tisch, chief executive of Loews Corp., to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.", "Perhaps his religious philanthropy is his ultimate reach for legitimacy. Lately he has expanded his Chabad initiatives, once confined to Russia and other former Soviet republics, to the West. This year he is setting up a school in Dresden to teach nonreligious Jewish emigres about the faith. Last year he opened a new school in Queens, N.Y. that caters to 350 Jewish students whose families formerly lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. \"It's about staying true to the legacy of my father,\" he says. \"All I want is for people in these places to know they are Jewish.\" A moment later he is whisked through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where a caravan of heavily guarded SUVs awaits.", "MORE FROM FORBES"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/", "author_name": "Chase Peterson-Withorn", "author_contrib_type": "Forbes Staff", "author_subcontext_header": "Billionaires", "author_about": "I cover the most successful entrepreneurs doing the biggest deals on the planet.

", "One of these is enough to stall city services, but all at the same time is a crippling problem. Yet, not only were cities dealing with these issues, they were also facing unrest around diversity, resentment towards police, and the critical factor of low affordable housing supply. ", "This low housing supply pushed builders to generate more starts, which in turn added fuel to many cities\u2019 planning department\u2019s mile-high list of challenges. With the growing resource constraints, already slow planning departments that depended on antiquated ways of working were taking up to triple the amount of time to process building permits. ", "It was clear that a solution was needed to help this process. ", "Avery Stark is an associate planner in the planning department for the City of Milpitas, CA, and crossed paths with software platform ", "Symbium", " at a conference two years ago. ", "\u201cMy director has been in the planning space for 20 years and this was something he talked about 10 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted a tool to show what could be built where. Symbium is actually an analysis of space, geographical issues, and land use regulations. Up to the pandemic, everything was done on paper. If you wanted to learn about ADUs, you had to come talk to us in person, on the phone, or by really long emails. Symbium has solved for that. The time savings is real\u2014I don\u2019t even know if I can quantify it.\u201d ", "Heather Peters was introduced to Symbium years ago. She now serves as a principal regional housing planner for the ", "Association of Bay Area Governments", " that just procured 10 licenses for Symbium\u2019s Plancheck product that will go to local governments selected to participate in a pilot program aimed to streamline the permitting process. ", "Peters described how the Symbium team went above and beyond to earn the right to work with her years ago. As she recalls, they noticed she was skeptical, so they took the time to understand her challenges around accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and then created an entire suite of software that addressed all the ordinances for ADUs in just three weeks, solving for everything that she laid out. Since then, it has been a match made in heaven. ", "Peters has a lot of experience with the state of California\u2019s government and explains the massive benefits that Symbium brings to a planning department. ", "\u201cIt is very staff intensive to have planners answer the phone to yes and no questions all day long over and over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is staff-heavy, resource-intensive, pretty boring work. It was challenging and continues to be challenging. Symbium was able to automate all of that, saving a lot of time for planners to do more discretionary review and more career fulfilling work. It also helps onboard new staff in an instant because they don\u2019t have to learn all that new code.\u201d", "Previously, planners would have to draft a letter to show that there are 27 codes that apply and the reasons why. Symbium is designed to automate anything that is a yes or no answer, putting planners into a role of editor. Peters also sees the opportunity for the software to reduce risk by giving accurate information to the homeowner, therefore avoiding potential lawsuits. ", "Connecting Data, Search and Services", "Leila Banijamali is the co-founder and CEO of Symbium, which she developed while studying at Stanford. The online platform is free to the public, giving them instant access to understand what is possible on their property. ", "\u201cWe started with the premise that the current state of the public\u2019s relationship with governments is so broken, particularly in regards to residential construction and the housing crisis,\u201d Banijamali said. \u201cData is fragmented \u2013 a city maintains the same data as the county, but both are updating at different times, so there is fragmentation. And, all of the data that is out there is hard to understand because there is different terminology from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The public pays a high cost and is powerless to fix it. We don\u2019t know what we are required to do and what we are allowed to do. We wanted to create a very beautiful and intuitive application to address it.\u201d", "On the platform, a user can enter in an address to instantly see a visual overview of a property with relevant data such as lot area, year built, assessments, improvement value, property details, and number of buildings. Information about each is available via a hover over feature, including building forms and permit history. ", "The user can turn on satellite mode that even includes tree cover, which is important for solar installations. Plus, there is a feature for a 3D visualization that shows building heights, neighboring properties, and the same data for adjacent lots. ", "Then comes the critical component: The user can click on the build button to see Complaw\u00ae that represents the laws and regulations, such as planning codes, in a visual and digestible form. The setbacks are automatically calculated by the software, which produces visual feedback to show the actual buildable area. Previously, this work was done by planning departments or the landowner by flipping through code books or map books.", "Next, the user can select from a list of ADU products offered by builders listed on the site, dropping them direct on the property to get a visual and understand the Complaw. Once the product is in place, costs appear along with information to contact the vendor. Symbium offers this product directory without commercializing the service for the builders. ", "\u201cThe ADU would turn red if it is in violation of a building code. That visualization gives instant feedback by analyzing the regulation on that particular property,\u201d Banijamali said. \u201cSome cities have pre-approved plans that will fast track the process.\u201d ", "Builders that use Symbium benefit from time savings by eliminating the typical mess of cross referencing that it takes to look at regulations and by not having to stay up to date on code changes. ", "Scott Bailey is the co-founder at ", "Bequall", " a California-based ADU builder and has had product listed on Symbium\u2019s platform for about six months.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a great educational tool versus a sales tool for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe often send people to use the platform first as opposed to getting new leads. We also use it to think through virtual placements before a site visit.\u201d", "Symbium also offers Plancheck as a solution for planning departments to enter in project information, which instantly filters through entire zoning codes to approve the project. ", "\u201cIt takes a month\u2019s long analysis and review and reduces it to just a number of clicks,\u201d said Banijamali. \u201cAs far as regulatory review, if it takes weeks or months to do the work, and it goes back and forth between various departments, it starts a new clock every time it\u2019s handed off in the workflow. In the case of Plancheck, the review is completed in a matter of clicks.\u201d", "For instance, a builder can nearly instantly find out how many properties in a city\u2019s area that a 600-square-foot ADU will fit in. Plus, a builder can find out the maximum square footage a building can be to cover as many residential lots in a city as possible, then work backwards to design a solution, all with a few clicks. ", "The End Game Of More Affordable Housing ", "Like most California cities, Stark says that Milpitas lacks affordable housing options. ", "\u201cAs part of a housing element, we are issued an annual amount of units to create,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hardest to create are the most affordable. The hardest thing to help a developer with is site selection, feasibility, understanding the product and how to sell it to the masses and how it is going to fit within the jurisdiction\u2019s needs. All the regulations that it usually takes a license to study. Through Symbium build, with ADUs specifically, here are all the sites in the city where an ADU will be permitted.\u201d ", "Because of these efficiencies, Stark is now able to get on an online call with a resident to see if their address is eligible for an ADU. The computing power of Symbium allows it to happen in real time and the property owner can see a visual with meeting with an architect or a designer.", "\u201cThey can pick a property and a product and see how it fits on their site,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would show if you needed entitlements. Then, they could come in today with that builder and it would be approved. Done. That\u2019s how simple it would be. They can expand and really make the best use of space without having to buy another lot. It does fit the gap for the by design affordable housing. The fact that Symbium can cut the planning department\u2019s work in half is a huge asset to creating more affordable housing.\u201d", "Symbium surveyed 19,000 homeowners who built ADUs in the previous year and the majority who responded said that they were challenged by not knowing the process and the costs involved and would have been able to save a lot of money if they had access to more information. So, homeowners verified that providing that information up front will be key to keeping the cost of housing down.", "Peters agrees that the digitization of the data is a critical element to adding speed that leads to more affordability. ", "\u201cSpeed is a true impediment to creating affordable solutions,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIf a project is under review for 18 months because you have limited staff or it takes too long to do a review physically, it translates directly to carrying costs on the project such as mortgage payments, interest, property taxes, abatements, all of that stuff. Underwriters for affordable projects will look at that. They will look at a jurisdiction and if they are known to move something quickly investors will go with them because there is less risk.\u201d ", "Future Solutions ", "Symbium is currently only in California but has plans to expand. With the growth, Banijamali expects the same challenges, like jurisdictions that don\u2019t have data in a digitized form; however, she remains dedicated to putting in the hard work to help cities step into the future. ", "Later in March 2022, Symbium will launch a new feature with the City of San Jose to allow the public to submit permit applications online, bypassing the planning department. The user will pay Symbium a small convenience fee to submit permits rather than going to the city\u2019s planning department. So, beyond being able to easily negotiate the feasibility of building an ADU, a homeowner will now be able to check on reroofing their house or improving the driveway.", "In the longer term future, Banijamali wants to evolve Symbium into an online property dashboard where everything that is important to the owner is all there in one place where it can be updated as needed, as opposed to the variety of places that currently house the information."]},

We felt it was mostly cosmetic and we could handle it,\u201d says Lindsay Lammers. \u201cIt was mustard yellow with an old leaky and rusted toilet, rusted fixtures, drains, and an old sink vanity. It also had really old lighting fixtures. The linoleum flooring was ripped and filthy, so we planned to do some luxury vinyl plank flooring. In addition to the floors, we would add a chair rail along the walls and paint.\u201d", "Without any prior experience personally or professionally, the couple began the renovations, and almost immediately, things took a turn for the worse. \u201cWhen [my husband] took out the screws to remove the light fixture, [we discovered] the electrical wires were tangled up.

Unfortunately, directly in its landing path were the copper pipes sticking out of the wall that attach to a sink. It crashed down on them and smashed them out of the wall.\u201d", "As a result, the hallway, all four bedrooms, the master bathroom, guest bathroom, and master walk-in closet were completely flooded. It took more than five hours of wet vacuuming and days of de-humidifiers running to remedy the situation. The carpets, carpet pads, baseboards, and flooring down to the concrete had to be ripped out.

The property appraisal and valuation equity action plan (PAVE) is aimed squarely at dismantling racial bias in the home lending and appraisal process and promoting generational wealth creation through homeownership. ", "When enacted, PAVE represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process. The PAVE task force, co-chaired by HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge and White House domestic policy advisor Susan Rice, is the first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address racial bias in home appraisals and includes senior leaders from 13 Cabinet and independent agencies and components of the Executive Office of the President.", "The coronavirus pandemic has drawn widespread attention to existing inequalities in American society, including the racial wealth gap in real estate. An appraisal plays a crucial role in buying, selling or refinancing a home, determining for the seller, buyer and lender how much a home is worth. And in an world where homeownership remains strongly linked to generational wealth building, an unbiased appraisal matters.", "President Biden first announced the creation of the task force on the June 1, 2021 centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, where he charged federal agencies with evaluating the causes, extent, and consequences of appraisal bias and establishing a transformative set of actions to root out inequity. ", "Homeownership remains the biggest driver of the wealth gap, with wide racial and ethnic disparities in homeownership rates and the financial return associated with owning a home. Today, the average Black and Hispanic or Latino households earn about half as much as the average white household and own only about 15 to 20 percent as much net wealth, according to the ", "Federal Reserve", ". This wealth gap has widened notably over the past few decades.

His go-to drink is Johnnie Walker Black Scotch and he has a similar taste for value in business too.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Finger says, of the 25% increase during the Covid-19 pandemic in apartment rents in key sunbelt cities like Tampa, Austin, Nashville and Houston. He points to rampant new construction nationwide, with so many buildings springing up that 600,000 new units came to market last year \u2014 nearly double the previous record. Meanwhile, those federal stimulus checks that fattened renters\u2019 wallets have been mostly spent and price increases for other necessities, like energy and food, are competing for their remaining dollars.", "\u201cI am absolutely programming for a major correction,\u2019\u2019 says Finger. That\u2019s why this past December he sold half his portfolio \u2014 15,000 units in Houston, Dallas and Atlanta \u2014 to real estate investor Greystar for $2 billion. He thought it was a rich price, equal to about 33 times expected 2022 net operating income (rental income minus expenses) of $60 million. Figuring the package would have fetched some 75% less before Covid-19, Finger concluded, \u201cit would be irresponsible not to sell.\u201d ", "Yet while Finger was a happy seller, Greystar was a happy buyer, says Kevin Kaberna, its investment director, who admires Finger\u2019s vigor and calls him a \u201cprolific developer of the nicest assets in best locations.\u201d With 54,000 units in Houston, Greystar was already the biggest landlord in town and Kaberna insists the market remains fantastic \u2013 he points out the nationwide vacancy rate is down to 5.2%, the lowest in at least 20 years, with outright shortages in the hottest markets. The biggest tailwind trend, says Dallas-based real estate consultant Ron Witten, is the \u201cundoubling\u201d of households as some Millennials (including those who moved home during the early pandemic days) leave their parents\u2019 nests, and others already out on their own jettison annoying roommates.", "How High Can The Rent Go?", "With apartment vacancy rates low and falling, landlords pushed through record rent hikes in 2021. Billionaire Marvy Finger thinks a flood of new rental units will hold down future increases, but other developers are more bullish.", "So what did Finger hold on to? He kept some trophies, like One Park Place, a high-end tower he built in downtown Houston adjacent to Discovery Green park, and 500 Crawford, a luxe mid-rise across the street from Minute Maid Park, where the Astros play. And some properties with sentimental value, like Colony Oaks, the very first two-story walkup complex that he built in Houston in 1960; selling that \u201cwould be like selling my first born.\u201d ", "Significantly, Finger also retained properties that he thought had more appreciation left in their underlying dirt. One fully leased 152-unit complex he built in the 1960s is on seven acres adjacent to the private Duchesne School. \u201cThe school now has nowhere to grow but on to that land,\u201d he muses. The land is currently appraised by the county at $30 million, but he thinks it\u2019s worth a lot more, especially in famously un-zoned Houston, \"the only major city that really has no restrictions to entry,\" he says. \"It's certainly allowed me to develop at will.\" And eventually, to redevelop. Which is why he says, \u201cI think what I\u2019m holding on to is worth more than what I\u2019m selling.\u201d ", "Finger grew up in an entrepreneurial family. In the 1940s his father Hyman moved from the piney woods near Beaumont, Texas and started Finger Furniture. Marvy grew up sweeping floors, selling furniture, and watching as Hyman made the mistake of bringing his brothers into his business. \u201cI saw the clashes he had with his family and I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a part of it,\u2019\u2019 says Finger, whose two brothers died years ago. Finger received an early discharge from the Army after a disorder led to most of his stomach being removed. In his early 20s he learned from mentor Ben McGuire how to combine loans from insurance companies with mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration to build two-story, wood-frame, brick veneered apartments with 100% financing. \u201cYou really could fully leverage them, without any equity at all,\u2019\u2019 he marvels.", "After successfully building dozens of middle-class apartments, Finger almost lost his shirt on his first office building project, which became one of the infamous \u201csee-through\u201d towers that languished empty, with unfinished interiors after the 1982 oil bust. He resolved to stick with apartments but decided to venture beyond the edges of Houston\u2019s endless sprawl\u2014going all the way to Chicago, where he met attorney Barry Nekritz. \u201cThe thing that made Chicago interesting to him was that it had the best transportation network in the country. You could get on a train and into the city and live near a food store,\u2019\u2019 says Nekritz. In Schaumburg, Illinois, Finger\u2019s contractors are now putting finishing touches on a new mid-rise complex located nearby an older (but still nice) one he put up 35 years ago. Says Nekritz, \u201cI\u2019m 83, but he won\u2019t let me retire because he won\u2019t retire.\u201d Finger still enjoys tennis, though a fly-fishing accident in Belize claimed one of his eyes a few years ago. ", "Nearly 30 years ago Finger\u2019s projects attracted the attention of the managers of Harvard University\u2019s now $54 billion endowment, who beginning in 1994 teamed up with him to build 16 projects, many of them in south Florida. Chip Douglas, who ran Harvard\u2019s real estate investments back then, recalls Finger\u2019s pursuit of \u201cthe art of building with quality and making the numbers work.\u201d At one building \u201che didn\u2019t like how the pool turned out so he ripped it up and started over.\u201d After a decade, Finger bought out most of Harvard\u2019s interest, but that prestigious relationship opened doors to all the capital he would ever need. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know Finger from Adam, but they sure as hell knew the Harvard seal,\u2019\u2019 Finger says.", "Since then, the builder has signed on other big name equity partners, including Houston billionaire Fayez Sarofim and the children of the late pipeline tycoon Dan Duncan. He has also built bigger, taller projects, such as the Museum Tower in Houston, appraised by Harris County at $100 million. ", "Along with tapping Texas money, Finger has built off his deep Houston connections. In 2006, he heard from his daughter Jill Jewett, then head of cultural affairs for Houston Mayor Bill White, that billionaire Rich Kinder was working with the city to build a city park called Discovery Green that would transform downtown. Forewarned, Finger scooped up a lot and set to work on a 340-unit high rise called One Park Place that would overlook the new park. Eyebrows raised; there hadn\u2019t been a residential tower built downtown in 20 years. He kitted it out with a replica of the pool at the Ritz-Carlton in Maui and lured a high-end grocery store to the ground floor. \u201cThe number one amenity is a food concession,\u201d he says. Still, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, tenants were hard to find, and it took years to fill the units. \u201cI never thought about risk on that project,\u201d he says now. The building is valued at $158 million. As Houston boomed post-Great Recession, he followed up with a string of luxe projects like the eight-story 500 Crawford, across from Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, and now appraised at $91 million. No vacancies. ", "Finger likes to daydream about what might someday replace the 20 acres with 540 garden apartments at the Creole On Yorktown that he built in the early 1970s with financing from Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns. It was the first and last time he ever incorporated an on-premises bar (a security nightmare). He almost lost the complex to bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, \u201cbut nobody wanted to buy a negative cash flowing property.\u201d Eventually, \u201cHouston\u2019s market did turn,\u201d and he\u2019s owned it ever since, with the tony Galleria neighborhood growing up around it. After the next oil bust in the early 1980s and the savings and loans crisis, Finger picked up some gems at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed to liquidate the failed S&Ls. His purchases included a three-acre parcel in the Galleria where he built a modest complex (valued at $10 million). The site, now adjacent to an Omni Hotel and the tony Houstonian Golf Club & Spa, could someday yield to a redevelopment worth many times that. ", "In late 2019 Finger raised $90 million to erect a new luxury tower on another nearby plot. But he called the project off even before Covid-19 hit, concerned that an inverting yield curve signaled economic trouble ahead. With today\u2019s high demand, that building would have filled up fast, but he doesn\u2019t regret pulling back. \u201cThe fundamentals have to make sense.\u201d When they do, Finger (plus heir apparent daughter Jill and son Edward) has the land on which to erect a number of high-rise redevelopments. He\u2019s in no hurry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now can\u2019t last,\u201d he says, referring to the rampant construction of apartment buildings. In Houston, for example, builders currently hold permits to build 42,000 units, more than twice the normal number. Prices for labor and materials are surging. Having seen bubbles before, Finger is content to wait. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get overbuilt again. The glut is definitely coming.\u201d ", "MORE FROM FORBES"]},

And, all of the data that is out there is hard to understand because there is different terminology from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The public pays a high cost and is powerless to fix it.

He comes from a family of small business owners and entrepreneurs, and two of his uncle's bodegas, which have been in the family for 30 years, will be converted into these dispensaries.

Firstly, while the stores aren\u2019t technically opening concurrently, with Dorchester opening in March of 2022 and Roslindale and Roxbury to follow in the summer of 2022, they were approved concurrently. We see the significance in a few different ways. ", "First off, Boston has been a very challenging place to get local approvals generally for cannabis. Locals are protective over their space and want to make sure they\u2019re comfortable with who\u2019s coming in. It speaks to the community process that Brian and Jaison Chavez, our partners at High Profile x Budega, ran and the trust the community has in them. ", "Another interesting point is Boston was the first major city on the East Coast to legalize recreational cannabis. Even with New Jersey and New York coming online soon, Boston will always remain one of the most sizable, influential markets on this side of the country, so these three licenses are an extremely valuable opportunity to build a brand in a major metropolitan area.

I\u2019m proud of the work these guys have done to achieve that.

", "AR:", " In Massachusetts, specifically, it's a very long and difficult process. First, you have to get local approval for a site as well as a significant amount of community support. There is a zoning process with the city which can take one to two years or sometimes longer. During this time you\u2019re spending a lot of time and money with a lot of uncertainty because you're holding real estate. The significant financial component can become incredibly challenging and is a huge barrier to entry, especially for social equity applicants who do not have access to capital. ", "Brian Chavez:", " Part of my and Jaison\u2019s story is that two of the properties were our uncle's properties, which allowed us to avoid some of the heavy real estate holding costs that are typically involved. We also ran the community process ourselves which resulted in a cost standpoint and accessibility, and was much easier than hiring consultants or lawyers. ", "AR:", " Part of the rationale for partnering with us is that our team could bring some other resources to the table, in terms of both finances and expertise. You have to actually come back and build the store out, a complex process which requires designs and permitting, while at the same time holding real estate where you\u2019re initially spending money without making it. It\u2019s a long, kind of torturous process. Our partnership with the Chavez brothers has allowed us to be successful in that both parties bring assets to the table that the other might not have been able to. ", "JB: Could you walk me through the current landscape of social equity, who got licenses and how, in Massachusetts? ", "AR", ": I think generally, there's a very low level of minority and social equity ownership in the Massachusetts cannabis industry. And that's not unique to Boston, but I think Boston is actually at the forefront of changing these patterns by implementing a system that does result in more social equity ownership. ", "In Boston right now it\u2019s one to one, meaning for every one social equity license, the city must issue one non-social equity license. So now you have a number of stores in Boston that are approved and on their way to opening that are social equity-owned, and we applaud the city for not only promoting social equity, but making strides in execution and bringing it to fruition. ", "JB: What is something exciting or notable about the Massachusetts market that people outside of it might not know? How does C3 fit into that? ", "AR:", " In general, there seems to be less emphasis on premium flower, and premium, top-shelf products as a whole, in Massachusetts, and the gap in that market excites us. We see a huge opportunity for our focus on high-end flower, a chance to offer the consumer something more curated and differentiated from a product quality standpoint. Of course there are retailers in Boston who carry some amazing brands and products, but we\u2019re excited to work with Brian and Jaison who share the same obsession with quality and want to target that corner of the market. ", "We\u2019re aiming to go the boutique route, offering our customers a curated selection of the highest- quality products on the market. ", "JB:", " ", "Personally, I hope bodega/corner store culture is the future of weed. What are your thoughts on that and why? ", "AR:", " Totally. We view these three stores as very much the neighborhood stores where we're serving the community in the spirit of the local bodega, making cannabis conveniently accessible. If you live in Dorchester currently, you have to go to another part of Boston or even outside of the city to get cannabis. So this is all very much about the neighborhood and community and Brian and Jaison are very much deep in these communities. ", "BC: ", "This is not a random part of Boston - we\u2019re actually from Dorchester. Dorchester is the location that we worked out with C3, but the other two are my uncle's bodegas - he has long been ingrained in these communities. These are long standing local stores where neighbors would go to buy groceries, milk, cigarettes, anything you need. We\u2019d like to look at it as we\u2019re just continuing what these stores and locations have already done for these communities, but in a new way, and providing convenient and safe access to high-quality cannabis.

With its IPO, EQT became the first major private equity firm in many years to tap the public markets. The gamble is paying off. Since then, its stock price is up some 288%, taking its market cap to about $34 billion\u2014roughly double that of The Carlyle Group, and only a few billion shy of Apollo Global Management.

It gives us a stronger balance sheet, so we can actually support these new initiatives.\u201d", "Unlike firms such as Carlyle and Apollo, which have embraced the ongoing boom in private credit, EQT focuses almost exclusively on active ownership strategies where it owns direct stakes in company.

Living spaces had to quickly adapt to new distance learning, telework, fitness, eldercare and quarantine needs. Killing the virus at home by washing everything that came through their doors became a priority for stressed-out parents. ", "Scientific discoveries since then have shown us how to stay safer and healthier at home, (no package scrubbing required!) \u2013 and how much our living spaces contributed to Covid transmission and related stressors.

", "\u201cThe next pandemic could come soon and be deadlier,\u201d warned a ", "headline from the Center for Global Development", " last summer. Here are four wellness design lessons for our homes worth implementing before it arrives. ", "1. Improve Indoor Air Quality", "According to the ", "Environmental Protection Agency, Americans spend about 90 percent of our time indoors", ", where concentrations of pollutants can be five times greater than outside. Air pollution increases vulnerability to Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses, with low income households at higher risk.", " \u201cThe issue of equity and environmental justice is real,\u201d shares Max Sherman, leader of engineering association ", "ASHRAE", "\u2019s Epidemic Task Force Residential Team. \u201cThese groups often live in places with poor outdoor air quality and high indoor density.

They can also reduce the concentration of aerosolized viruses, thus limiting the spread of Covid and other airborne contagions. ", "The White House released a ", "fact sheet", " on Thursday announcing a new focus on improving ventilation in buildings. Its recommendations make tremendous sense, and should apply to all the places where people live \u2014 from multi-family buildings to assisted living facilities and nursing homes to dorms and single family homes \u2014 not just where they work, visit or study. These initiatives can be supported through programs like Fannie Mae\u2019s ", "Healthy Housing Rewards", ". ", "2. Make Safe Water Access Universal", "Access to safe water at home should be a national standard, but its shocking lack contributed to excessive Covid death rates among Native Americans and Alaskan Natives. Among the causes for the virus\u2019 prevalence among these populations, according to ", "public health professionals", ", was lack of safe water supply at home, making the CDC\u2019s regular hand-washing instructions difficult for many poverty-stricken reservation residents. This needs to be remedied along with the lead pipe removal included in the ", "infrastructure bill ", "passed last year. ", "3. Mandate Minimum Outdoor Space Requirements", "Another lesson learned from Covid is the importance of outdoor space to our health and well-being. When parks, beaches and trails were closed in the early months of the pandemic, millions of Americans were cut off from their only connection to natural settings. \u201cA growing body of research points to the beneficial effects that exposure to the natural world has on health, reducing stress and promoting healing,\u201d wrote Jim Robbins in a January 2020 ", "Yale Environment 360 article", ". ", "Too many households \u2013 especially low income urbanites \u2013 lack easy access to nature. (The inflated cost of gas is compounding access challenges this season.) That deficit can be remedied with residential building codes requiring green outdoor space. These standards can be as simple as compact patios or balconies with planters, or a shared courtyard or roof garden with room for social distancing when needed.", " 4. Increase Accessible Housing Stock", "Accessible housing is a must for our rapidly-aging population, and needs to be offered at all price points. When nursing homes became early Covid super spreaders, many families took their loved ones out. Some may never return, and other aging adults will need new housing in the coming years, either with family or on their own. ", "A significant percent of seniors (41% between 65 and 79 and 71% aged 80 and older, according to the ", "Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies", "), have physical conditions that necessitate accessibility features that can be used by any individual of any age or ability. ", "There is a tremendous deficit of housing \u2013 including family members\u2019 homes, unless they remodel \u2013 that can accommodate this growing demographic. Increasing this stock now is imperative. ", "Extending tax benefits and streamlining permitting incentives to builders and developers that include accessible entries, kitchens, bathrooms and at least one bedroom into their projects can help alleviate the shortage. So can incentivizing residentially-compatible opportunity zones for accessible housing development. ", "Including free, permit-approved, accessible floor plans for accessory dwelling units \u2013 i.e., creating ", "granny flats that are truly grandmother-friendly", " \u2014 on municipal building department websites can also help add accessible housing stock to a community.", "Afterword", "The home building industry and affordable housing advocates may assert that including these wellness design components will increase home prices and rents, already out of reach for millions of Americans.", "The same arguments are made for sustainability initiatives. For example, phasing out residential gas availability \u2014 something being discussed and implemented in ", "environmentally-conscious cities and states", " \u2014 has gotten pushback from ", "minority community advocates", " tied to likely higher utility bills. ", "If broadly implemented, especially statewide in California, these new codes will almost certainly make induction cooktops and ranges more popular and affordable. (This was the case for LEDs throughout much of the past two decades.)", "On the wellness front, Covid has already achieved these outcomes for bidet toilet seats and air purifiers. Building codes, design standards and housing policies can do the same for ventilation system upgrades, accessibility features like voice control, and modular ADUs with patio planters.

Not If This Billionaire Is Right", "corpus_content_parts": ["Marvy Finger recently sold half his portfolio of Sunbelt apartments for $2 billion, saying the Covid-crazed rental market has peaked. The buyers, pointing to a 20-year low vacancy rate, disagree. ", "For a real estate tycoon, Marvy Finger\u2019s second-floor offices in a low-slung Houston office building are as modest as the first apartment buildings he erected nearly 60 years ago \u2014 and still owns. \u201cI like simplicity and livability,\u201d says the 5-foot-5-inch, slightly stooped 86-year-old, whose unassuming uniform consists of khakis, oxford shirt, penny loafers and an Hermes tie offset by a Timex watch. His go-to drink is Johnnie Walker Black Scotch and he has a similar taste for value in business too.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Finger says, of the 25% increase during the Covid-19 pandemic in apartment rents in key sunbelt cities like Tampa, Austin, Nashville and Houston. He points to rampant new construction nationwide, with so many buildings springing up that 600,000 new units came to market last year \u2014 nearly double the previous record. Meanwhile, those federal stimulus checks that fattened renters\u2019 wallets have been mostly spent and price increases for other necessities, like energy and food, are competing for their remaining dollars.", "\u201cI am absolutely programming for a major correction,\u2019\u2019 says Finger. That\u2019s why this past December he sold half his portfolio \u2014 15,000 units in Houston, Dallas and Atlanta \u2014 to real estate investor Greystar for $2 billion. He thought it was a rich price, equal to about 33 times expected 2022 net operating income (rental income minus expenses) of $60 million. Figuring the package would have fetched some 75% less before Covid-19, Finger concluded, \u201cit would be irresponsible not to sell.\u201d ", "Yet while Finger was a happy seller, Greystar was a happy buyer, says Kevin Kaberna, its investment director, who admires Finger\u2019s vigor and calls him a \u201cprolific developer of the nicest assets in best locations.\u201d With 54,000 units in Houston, Greystar was already the biggest landlord in town and Kaberna insists the market remains fantastic \u2013 he points out the nationwide vacancy rate is down to 5.2%, the lowest in at least 20 years, with outright shortages in the hottest markets. The biggest tailwind trend, says Dallas-based real estate consultant Ron Witten, is the \u201cundoubling\u201d of households as some Millennials (including those who moved home during the early pandemic days) leave their parents\u2019 nests, and others already out on their own jettison annoying roommates.", "How High Can The Rent Go?", "With apartment vacancy rates low and falling, landlords pushed through record rent hikes in 2021. Billionaire Marvy Finger thinks a flood of new rental units will hold down future increases, but other developers are more bullish.", "So what did Finger hold on to? He kept some trophies, like One Park Place, a high-end tower he built in downtown Houston adjacent to Discovery Green park, and 500 Crawford, a luxe mid-rise across the street from Minute Maid Park, where the Astros play. And some properties with sentimental value, like Colony Oaks, the very first two-story walkup complex that he built in Houston in 1960; selling that \u201cwould be like selling my first born.\u201d ", "Significantly, Finger also retained properties that he thought had more appreciation left in their underlying dirt. One fully leased 152-unit complex he built in the 1960s is on seven acres adjacent to the private Duchesne School. \u201cThe school now has nowhere to grow but on to that land,\u201d he muses. The land is currently appraised by the county at $30 million, but he thinks it\u2019s worth a lot more, especially in famously un-zoned Houston, \"the only major city that really has no restrictions to entry,\" he says. \"It's certainly allowed me to develop at will.\" And eventually, to redevelop. Which is why he says, \u201cI think what I\u2019m holding on to is worth more than what I\u2019m selling.\u201d ", "Finger grew up in an entrepreneurial family. In the 1940s his father Hyman moved from the piney woods near Beaumont, Texas and started Finger Furniture. Marvy grew up sweeping floors, selling furniture, and watching as Hyman made the mistake of bringing his brothers into his business. \u201cI saw the clashes he had with his family and I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a part of it,\u2019\u2019 says Finger, whose two brothers died years ago. Finger received an early discharge from the Army after a disorder led to most of his stomach being removed. In his early 20s he learned from mentor Ben McGuire how to combine loans from insurance companies with mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration to build two-story, wood-frame, brick veneered apartments with 100% financing. \u201cYou really could fully leverage them, without any equity at all,\u2019\u2019 he marvels.", "After successfully building dozens of middle-class apartments, Finger almost lost his shirt on his first office building project, which became one of the infamous \u201csee-through\u201d towers that languished empty, with unfinished interiors after the 1982 oil bust. He resolved to stick with apartments but decided to venture beyond the edges of Houston\u2019s endless sprawl\u2014going all the way to Chicago, where he met attorney Barry Nekritz. \u201cThe thing that made Chicago interesting to him was that it had the best transportation network in the country. You could get on a train and into the city and live near a food store,\u2019\u2019 says Nekritz. In Schaumburg, Illinois, Finger\u2019s contractors are now putting finishing touches on a new mid-rise complex located nearby an older (but still nice) one he put up 35 years ago. Says Nekritz, \u201cI\u2019m 83, but he won\u2019t let me retire because he won\u2019t retire.\u201d Finger still enjoys tennis, though a fly-fishing accident in Belize claimed one of his eyes a few years ago. ", "Nearly 30 years ago Finger\u2019s projects attracted the attention of the managers of Harvard University\u2019s now $54 billion endowment, who beginning in 1994 teamed up with him to build 16 projects, many of them in south Florida. Chip Douglas, who ran Harvard\u2019s real estate investments back then, recalls Finger\u2019s pursuit of \u201cthe art of building with quality and making the numbers work.\u201d At one building \u201che didn\u2019t like how the pool turned out so he ripped it up and started over.\u201d After a decade, Finger bought out most of Harvard\u2019s interest, but that prestigious relationship opened doors to all the capital he would ever need. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know Finger from Adam, but they sure as hell knew the Harvard seal,\u2019\u2019 Finger says.", "Since then, the builder has signed on other big name equity partners, including Houston billionaire Fayez Sarofim and the children of the late pipeline tycoon Dan Duncan. He has also built bigger, taller projects, such as the Museum Tower in Houston, appraised by Harris County at $100 million. ", "Along with tapping Texas money, Finger has built off his deep Houston connections. In 2006, he heard from his daughter Jill Jewett, then head of cultural affairs for Houston Mayor Bill White, that billionaire Rich Kinder was working with the city to build a city park called Discovery Green that would transform downtown. Forewarned, Finger scooped up a lot and set to work on a 340-unit high rise called One Park Place that would overlook the new park. Eyebrows raised; there hadn\u2019t been a residential tower built downtown in 20 years. He kitted it out with a replica of the pool at the Ritz-Carlton in Maui and lured a high-end grocery store to the ground floor. \u201cThe number one amenity is a food concession,\u201d he says. Still, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, tenants were hard to find, and it took years to fill the units. \u201cI never thought about risk on that project,\u201d he says now. The building is valued at $158 million. As Houston boomed post-Great Recession, he followed up with a string of luxe projects like the eight-story 500 Crawford, across from Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, and now appraised at $91 million. No vacancies. ", "Finger likes to daydream about what might someday replace the 20 acres with 540 garden apartments at the Creole On Yorktown that he built in the early 1970s with financing from Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns. It was the first and last time he ever incorporated an on-premises bar (a security nightmare). He almost lost the complex to bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, \u201cbut nobody wanted to buy a negative cash flowing property.\u201d Eventually, \u201cHouston\u2019s market did turn,\u201d and he\u2019s owned it ever since, with the tony Galleria neighborhood growing up around it. After the next oil bust in the early 1980s and the savings and loans crisis, Finger picked up some gems at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed to liquidate the failed S&Ls. His purchases included a three-acre parcel in the Galleria where he built a modest complex (valued at $10 million). The site, now adjacent to an Omni Hotel and the tony Houstonian Golf Club & Spa, could someday yield to a redevelopment worth many times that. ", "In late 2019 Finger raised $90 million to erect a new luxury tower on another nearby plot. But he called the project off even before Covid-19 hit, concerned that an inverting yield curve signaled economic trouble ahead. With today\u2019s high demand, that building would have filled up fast, but he doesn\u2019t regret pulling back. \u201cThe fundamentals have to make sense.\u201d When they do, Finger (plus heir apparent daughter Jill and son Edward) has the land on which to erect a number of high-rise redevelopments. He\u2019s in no hurry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now can\u2019t last,\u201d he says, referring to the rampant construction of apartment buildings. In Houston, for example, builders currently hold permits to build 42,000 units, more than twice the normal number. Prices for labor and materials are surging. Having seen bubbles before, Finger is content to wait. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get overbuilt again. The glut is definitely coming.\u201d ", "MORE FROM FORBES"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/", "author_name": "Christopher Helman", "author_contrib_type": "Forbes Staff", "author_subcontext_header": "Energy", "author_about": "", "author_social_links": ["https://www.twitter.com/chrishelman", "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-helman/0/718/a92", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/feed/"]}},

While the decision whether or not to purchase a Bronco is a no-brainer, buyers are forced to decide between a 2-door or 4-door body style \u2014 herein lies the true dilemma.", "Most shoppers (over 70 percent, according to Ford) have been choosing the 4-door, which is roomier and better suited for families. But, there are still very valid arguments for purchasing the 2-door Bronco \u2014 my personal favorite:", "The 2-Door Ford Bronco is Better Proportioned", "The original Ford Bronco, which debuted in 1966, was a compact 2-door truck with very simple styling offered in three different body configurations \u2014 2-door wagon, half-cab pickup, and open-body roadster. The 2-door style continued through the second-generation until the last fifth-generation models rolled off the line in 1996.", "Ford, targeting the Jeep Wrangler (and observing the success of the Wrangler Unlimited), decided to offer the new sixth-generation Bronco in both door configurations. The 2-door model is well proportioned and is visually correct in terms of being historically accurate. The doors are long, and they nicely fill the gap between the two wheels \u2014 nearly perfectly centered. The roof\u2019s prominent three pillars are equally as attractive and add strength to the look. Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said about the 4-door model, which is awkwardly stretched with the added fourth roof pillar, 50 percent more side glass, and double the number of door handles. Worse, the doors are shorter and the stubby second doors are forced into the wheel arch. ", "The 2-Door Bronco is More Agile Off-Road", "Off-roading prowess requires much more than a capable 4x4 system. Vehicles need to be agile and have good approach, departure, and breakover angles \u2014 think of it as the maximum obstacle height that a vehicle can drive over without hitting the chassis between its wheelbase. This typically requires a short wheelbase.", "The 2-door Ford Bronco has a wheelbase measuring 100.4 inches. That\u2019s much shorter than the 4-door Bronco, which has a wheelbase measuring 116.1 inches. By the tape, the Bronco 2-door boasts a 43.2 degree approach angle, a 37.2 degree departure angle, and a 29 degree breakover angle. Although the 4-door matches the 2-door\u2019s approach angle, its 37.0 degree departure and 26.3 degree breakover angle are worse. ", "It is imporant to mention that Ford offers the Sasquatch option on all Bronco models. This adds more aggressive 35-inch tires and the High-Performance Off-Road Stability Suspension (HOSS) that improves ground clearance and breakover angles, but it doesn\u2019t make the 4-door more agile off-road than the 2-door model. ", "The Manual Gearbox is a Better Match to the 2-Door", "Manual gearboxes are becoming extinct, but Ford is offered a 7-speed row-your-own gearbox in the Bronco. According to Ford, only about 15 percent of buyers overall are opting for the manual gearbox, but that number climbs to 25 percent of 2-door owners \u2014 signaling that these buyers may be more passionate about driving. Opting for the manual transmission means that owners are also satisfied with Ford\u2019s turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost inline-4 engine, as the company isn\u2019t pairing the manual with its more powerful turbocharged 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6.", "Climb behind the wheel of the 2-door Bronco with the 7-speed manual gearbox and its a joy to drive \u2014 whether on- or off-road. The shorter wheelbase makes the vehicle agile, and the larger side windows offer a more expansive view of the outside world. The Bronco 2-door with the 7-speed is the lightest variant in the model range, too, undercutting the 4-door model by nearly 200 pounds. This only improves the fun quotient. ", "The 2-Door Bronco is Less Money", "The 2-door Ford Bronco has a base price of $30,800 \u2014 which is very reasonable when compared to its competition. The 4-door model costs about $5,000 more, which is a 15 percent pricing premium before adding popular trims or options.", "That $5,000 will help those interested in the 2-door model bump up to a more premium Bronco grade, such as the Black Diamond (the model pictured in the images). Or, the savings may be used to upgrade to the 35-inch Mud-Terrain tires, which also adds the Advanced 4x4 system \u2014 my personal recommendation.", "The 2-Door Bronco is More Exclusive", "Considering that 70 percent of the sixth-generation Broncos on the road will be 4-door models, owning a 2-door will be unique \u2014 significantly more rare than the commonplace family model. While nobody can speculate on future values, low volume models have traditionally captured more money on the secondary market as they are more desirable to brand aficionados and purists, especially when they are fitted with rare components (e.g., 7-speed manual) or unique options."]},

Two more Boston-area dispensaries in Roxbury and Roslindale are expected to follow this summer.", "C3\u2019s dispensaries, called ", "High Profile x Budega", ", opened in partnership with local social equity licensee Brian Chavez. High Profile is a subsidiary of C3 and Budega is Chavez\u2019s brainchild, so the combined name reflects the shared efforts of both parties in the new venture.", "The three retail stores, High Profile x La Budega, will be firsts for both C3 in Massachusetts and Brian Chavez as an operator overall, making them the one of the only social equity applicants in the country to obtain licenses for three storefronts in Boston. ", "Chavez will serve as the CEO of the partnership. He comes from a family of small business owners and entrepreneurs, and two of his uncle's bodegas, which have been in the family for 30 years, will be converted into these dispensaries. Brian and his brother Jaison ran an extensive community engagement process to get the three locations approved. Many in the community sent letters of support for the projects; in total, more than 1,000 letters advocating for the approval of the three sites were submitted.", "The stores will carry a wide array of cannabis products in all categories, and will specifically feature Cloud Cover flower, prerolls, concentrates and vape cartridges produced at C3's cultivation and processing facility in Franklin, Massachusetts.", "Here, I talk with Ankur Rungta, founder & CEO of C3 Industries and Brian Chavez, CEO of High Profile x Budega about the social equity landscape in Massachusetts right now, the significance of this opening and more.", "Jackie Bryant: What is the significance of this being the first equity recipients to open concurrent stores at the same time? Why is that notable? ", "Ankur Rungta:", " I think there are three points to make here. Firstly, while the stores aren\u2019t technically opening concurrently, with Dorchester opening in March of 2022 and Roslindale and Roxbury to follow in the summer of 2022, they were approved concurrently. We see the significance in a few different ways. ", "First off, Boston has been a very challenging place to get local approvals generally for cannabis. Locals are protective over their space and want to make sure they\u2019re comfortable with who\u2019s coming in. It speaks to the community process that Brian and Jaison Chavez, our partners at High Profile x Budega, ran and the trust the community has in them. ", "Another interesting point is Boston was the first major city on the East Coast to legalize recreational cannabis. Even with New Jersey and New York coming online soon, Boston will always remain one of the most sizable, influential markets on this side of the country, so these three licenses are an extremely valuable opportunity to build a brand in a major metropolitan area. ", "Lastly, I would also say that we're not aware of any other social equity licensees that have gotten a series of licenses for three storefronts (the maximum permitted in Massachusetts) versus only one. I\u2019m proud of the work these guys have done to achieve that. ", "JB: For people who don't live in legal states or who aren't in MA, can you speak to the difficulties of becoming licensed in the state? How is it harder for equity applicants? ", "AR:", " In Massachusetts, specifically, it's a very long and difficult process. First, you have to get local approval for a site as well as a significant amount of community support. There is a zoning process with the city which can take one to two years or sometimes longer. During this time you\u2019re spending a lot of time and money with a lot of uncertainty because you're holding real estate. The significant financial component can become incredibly challenging and is a huge barrier to entry, especially for social equity applicants who do not have access to capital. ", "Brian Chavez:", " Part of my and Jaison\u2019s story is that two of the properties were our uncle's properties, which allowed us to avoid some of the heavy real estate holding costs that are typically involved. We also ran the community process ourselves which resulted in a cost standpoint and accessibility, and was much easier than hiring consultants or lawyers. ", "AR:", " Part of the rationale for partnering with us is that our team could bring some other resources to the table, in terms of both finances and expertise. You have to actually come back and build the store out, a complex process which requires designs and permitting, while at the same time holding real estate where you\u2019re initially spending money without making it. It\u2019s a long, kind of torturous process. Our partnership with the Chavez brothers has allowed us to be successful in that both parties bring assets to the table that the other might not have been able to. ", "JB: Could you walk me through the current landscape of social equity, who got licenses and how, in Massachusetts? ", "AR", ": I think generally, there's a very low level of minority and social equity ownership in the Massachusetts cannabis industry. And that's not unique to Boston, but I think Boston is actually at the forefront of changing these patterns by implementing a system that does result in more social equity ownership. ", "In Boston right now it\u2019s one to one, meaning for every one social equity license, the city must issue one non-social equity license. So now you have a number of stores in Boston that are approved and on their way to opening that are social equity-owned, and we applaud the city for not only promoting social equity, but making strides in execution and bringing it to fruition. ", "JB: What is something exciting or notable about the Massachusetts market that people outside of it might not know? How does C3 fit into that? ", "AR:", " In general, there seems to be less emphasis on premium flower, and premium, top-shelf products as a whole, in Massachusetts, and the gap in that market excites us. We see a huge opportunity for our focus on high-end flower, a chance to offer the consumer something more curated and differentiated from a product quality standpoint. Of course there are retailers in Boston who carry some amazing brands and products, but we\u2019re excited to work with Brian and Jaison who share the same obsession with quality and want to target that corner of the market. ", "We\u2019re aiming to go the boutique route, offering our customers a curated selection of the highest- quality products on the market. ", "JB:", " ", "Personally, I hope bodega/corner store culture is the future of weed. What are your thoughts on that and why? ", "AR:", " Totally. We view these three stores as very much the neighborhood stores where we're serving the community in the spirit of the local bodega, making cannabis conveniently accessible. If you live in Dorchester currently, you have to go to another part of Boston or even outside of the city to get cannabis. So this is all very much about the neighborhood and community and Brian and Jaison are very much deep in these communities. ", "BC: ", "This is not a random part of Boston - we\u2019re actually from Dorchester. Dorchester is the location that we worked out with C3, but the other two are my uncle's bodegas - he has long been ingrained in these communities. These are long standing local stores where neighbors would go to buy groceries, milk, cigarettes, anything you need. We\u2019d like to look at it as we\u2019re just continuing what these stores and locations have already done for these communities, but in a new way, and providing convenient and safe access to high-quality cannabis. ", "JB: Do you have anything else to add? Free space! What did I miss? ", "BC:", " I want to not only build success for my family and for myself but also to pay it forward. I feel very blessed and fortunate to have accomplished all that I have and I\u2019m excited for the next phase of actually opening these three stores.

This was not an idle question, as this was a friend who closely follows the latest trends from the region and tastes numerous current releases; as he had not heard much in the way of great reports about this vintage, he wondered if the 2014 Cristal was anything special. ", "As you\u2019ll see from my review at the end of this article, the wine was indeed quite alluring. It is different from the last two releases of 2012 and 2013, but then again, it should be, as this is a prestige cuv\u00e9e that reflects the particulars of each growing season. Recent releases, such as 2012 and 2008, display the variances in the vintages and in the finished wines; 2008 was a powerful vintage throughout Champagne, while 2012 was more refined. Yet both were first-rate examples of Cristal, which is saying something.", "Cristal was first produced by the house of Louis Roederer of Reims in 1876 for Tsar Alexander II of Russia, who was an enthusiast of the firm\u2019s Champagnes, but wanted something a bit more unique. That original release was packaged in a crystal bottle, hence the name, and for almost 150 years, the name Cristal has come to be identified with this highly distinctive, iconic Champagne. ", "Given the value of this marque and its familiarity with consumers around the world, it would be easy for the principals at Roederer to rest on their laurels. Thankfully, this has not been the case, as CEO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rouzaud and cellar master Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon have consistently made the necessary efforts to elevate Roederer Cristal to even greater heights. The house is among the leading proponents of biodynamic farming, and since 2012, Cristal is made entirely from grapes farmed with this approach; the image above shows how these vineyards are tended by plow horses, eliminating a great deal of human and chemical intervention.", "The rainy, cool climate of Champagne can make biodynamic farming, with its specific demands (no pesticides, the use of supplements in the soil), a rather difficult task in this region, yet Roederer has endorsed this manner of viticulture for the past two decades. The results have been remarkable, as the style of Cristal, as well as its other top cuv\u00e9es has become more refined. I used to think of Cristal as a powerhouse Champagne that was a bit disjointed upon release, but the wine for me now is more elegant than ever, as yes, more distinguished. ", "So getting back to the 2014. It\u2019s not the same style as the 2008 or 2012, two remarkable vintages, nor should it be. 2014 was rather rainy during the spring, and early predictions were not great, but as noted on the Roederer website, \u201cSeptember was hot, sunny, and very dry ... weather we would usually associate with the month of August.\u201d This resulted in ideal ripening, while acidity levels were excellent; the resulting wine displays impeccable harmony. ", "So the 2014 Roederer Cristal is another great success; open a bottle and you\u2019ll not only impress your guests, but you\u2019ll also be thrilled at how graceful, complex, and yes, delicious, this cuv\u00e9e truly is!", "2014 Roederer Cristal ", "- A blend of 60% Pinot Noir, 40% Chardonnay; 32% of the wine was aged in oak; dosage of 7 grams per liter (thus a Brut classification). Light yellow with a beautiful, persistent stream of small bubbles. Lovely aromas of pear, lemon zest and magnolia. Medium-full, the wine glides across the palate; there is an extremely lengthy finish that is remarkably polished and sensual. Never overpowering in any aspect, this is as elegant and as understated a release of this wine in several years. Absolutely delicious now, this has the acidity and texture to drink well for many years - a signature of Cristal - with peak in 10-12 years or perhaps a few years longer.

While the decision whether or not to purchase a Bronco is a no-brainer, buyers are forced to decide between a 2-door or 4-door body style \u2014 herein lies the true dilemma.", "Most shoppers (over 70 percent, according to Ford) have been choosing the 4-door, which is roomier and better suited for families. But, there are still very valid arguments for purchasing the 2-door Bronco \u2014 my personal favorite:", "The 2-Door Ford Bronco is Better Proportioned", "The original Ford Bronco, which debuted in 1966, was a compact 2-door truck with very simple styling offered in three different body configurations \u2014 2-door wagon, half-cab pickup, and open-body roadster. The 2-door style continued through the second-generation until the last fifth-generation models rolled off the line in 1996.", "Ford, targeting the Jeep Wrangler (and observing the success of the Wrangler Unlimited), decided to offer the new sixth-generation Bronco in both door configurations. The 2-door model is well proportioned and is visually correct in terms of being historically accurate. The doors are long, and they nicely fill the gap between the two wheels \u2014 nearly perfectly centered. The roof\u2019s prominent three pillars are equally as attractive and add strength to the look. Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said about the 4-door model, which is awkwardly stretched with the added fourth roof pillar, 50 percent more side glass, and double the number of door handles. Worse, the doors are shorter and the stubby second doors are forced into the wheel arch. ", "The 2-Door Bronco is More Agile Off-Road", "Off-roading prowess requires much more than a capable 4x4 system. Vehicles need to be agile and have good approach, departure, and breakover angles \u2014 think of it as the maximum obstacle height that a vehicle can drive over without hitting the chassis between its wheelbase. This typically requires a short wheelbase.", "The 2-door Ford Bronco has a wheelbase measuring 100.4 inches. That\u2019s much shorter than the 4-door Bronco, which has a wheelbase measuring 116.1 inches. By the tape, the Bronco 2-door boasts a 43.2 degree approach angle, a 37.2 degree departure angle, and a 29 degree breakover angle. Although the 4-door matches the 2-door\u2019s approach angle, its 37.0 degree departure and 26.3 degree breakover angle are worse. ", "It is imporant to mention that Ford offers the Sasquatch option on all Bronco models. This adds more aggressive 35-inch tires and the High-Performance Off-Road Stability Suspension (HOSS) that improves ground clearance and breakover angles, but it doesn\u2019t make the 4-door more agile off-road than the 2-door model. ", "The Manual Gearbox is a Better Match to the 2-Door", "Manual gearboxes are becoming extinct, but Ford is offered a 7-speed row-your-own gearbox in the Bronco. According to Ford, only about 15 percent of buyers overall are opting for the manual gearbox, but that number climbs to 25 percent of 2-door owners \u2014 signaling that these buyers may be more passionate about driving. Opting for the manual transmission means that owners are also satisfied with Ford\u2019s turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost inline-4 engine, as the company isn\u2019t pairing the manual with its more powerful turbocharged 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6.", "Climb behind the wheel of the 2-door Bronco with the 7-speed manual gearbox and its a joy to drive \u2014 whether on- or off-road. The shorter wheelbase makes the vehicle agile, and the larger side windows offer a more expansive view of the outside world. The Bronco 2-door with the 7-speed is the lightest variant in the model range, too, undercutting the 4-door model by nearly 200 pounds. This only improves the fun quotient. ", "The 2-Door Bronco is Less Money", "The 2-door Ford Bronco has a base price of $30,800 \u2014 which is very reasonable when compared to its competition. The 4-door model costs about $5,000 more, which is a 15 percent pricing premium before adding popular trims or options.", "That $5,000 will help those interested in the 2-door model bump up to a more premium Bronco grade, such as the Black Diamond (the model pictured in the images). Or, the savings may be used to upgrade to the 35-inch Mud-Terrain tires, which also adds the Advanced 4x4 system \u2014 my personal recommendation.", "The 2-Door Bronco is More Exclusive", "Considering that 70 percent of the sixth-generation Broncos on the road will be 4-door models, owning a 2-door will be unique \u2014 significantly more rare than the commonplace family model. While nobody can speculate on future values, low volume models have traditionally captured more money on the secondary market as they are more desirable to brand aficionados and purists, especially when they are fitted with rare components (e.g., 7-speed manual) or unique options."], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/", "author_name": "Michael Harley", "author_contrib_type": "Contributor", "author_subcontext_header": "Cars & Bikes", "author_about": "", "author_social_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-harley-2930827/", "https://www.instagram.com/michaelharley", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/feed/", "https://www.amazon.com/One-More-Than-10-Porsche/dp/0989114945/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CGYODF1G5GSO&dchild=1&keywords=one+more+than+10+singer+and+the+porsche+911&qid=1616311345&sprefix=one+more+than%2Caps%2C194&sr=8-1"]}},

The initial reactions to the 737 Max accidents were to say that Indonesia had a poor safety record and to try to denigrate the pilots in Ethiopia, prior to us all realizing that it was actually an aircraft issue and not a pilot issue.\u201d", "The China Eastern plane that crashed was not the 737 Max but a Boeing 737, \u201cone of the safest aircraft out there,\u201d says Baier. \u201cThere are over 5,000 of them in operation. I think they\u2019ve got almost 1,200 in operation in China.

That's how accidents used to be investigated,\u201d says Baier. \u201cIt would not mean all hope is lost on getting an answer to what happened. But then we\u2019re not talking months, we\u2019re talking years based on the kind of impact and how scattered the debris is.\u201d", "The crash investigation is being led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). \u201cThey're a fairly sophisticated authority,\u201d says Baier. \u201cThey have a pretty safe airspace.

It is different from the last two releases of 2012 and 2013, but then again, it should be, as this is a prestige cuv\u00e9e that reflects the particulars of each growing season. Recent releases, such as 2012 and 2008, display the variances in the vintages and in the finished wines; 2008 was a powerful vintage throughout Champagne, while 2012 was more refined. Yet both were first-rate examples of Cristal, which is saying something.", "Cristal was first produced by the house of Louis Roederer of Reims in 1876 for Tsar Alexander II of Russia, who was an enthusiast of the firm\u2019s Champagnes, but wanted something a bit more unique. That original release was packaged in a crystal bottle, hence the name, and for almost 150 years, the name Cristal has come to be identified with this highly distinctive, iconic Champagne. ", "Given the value of this marque and its familiarity with consumers around the world, it would be easy for the principals at Roederer to rest on their laurels. Thankfully, this has not been the case, as CEO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rouzaud and cellar master Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon have consistently made the necessary efforts to elevate Roederer Cristal to even greater heights. The house is among the leading proponents of biodynamic farming, and since 2012, Cristal is made entirely from grapes farmed with this approach; the image above shows how these vineyards are tended by plow horses, eliminating a great deal of human and chemical intervention.", "The rainy, cool climate of Champagne can make biodynamic farming, with its specific demands (no pesticides, the use of supplements in the soil), a rather difficult task in this region, yet Roederer has endorsed this manner of viticulture for the past two decades. The results have been remarkable, as the style of Cristal, as well as its other top cuv\u00e9es has become more refined. I used to think of Cristal as a powerhouse Champagne that was a bit disjointed upon release, but the wine for me now is more elegant than ever, as yes, more distinguished. ", "So getting back to the 2014. It\u2019s not the same style as the 2008 or 2012, two remarkable vintages, nor should it be. 2014 was rather rainy during the spring, and early predictions were not great, but as noted on the Roederer website, \u201cSeptember was hot, sunny, and very dry ... weather we would usually associate with the month of August.\u201d This resulted in ideal ripening, while acidity levels were excellent; the resulting wine displays impeccable harmony. ", "So the 2014 Roederer Cristal is another great success; open a bottle and you\u2019ll not only impress your guests, but you\u2019ll also be thrilled at how graceful, complex, and yes, delicious, this cuv\u00e9e truly is!", "2014 Roederer Cristal ", "- A blend of 60% Pinot Noir, 40% Chardonnay; 32% of the wine was aged in oak; dosage of 7 grams per liter (thus a Brut classification). Light yellow with a beautiful, persistent stream of small bubbles. Lovely aromas of pear, lemon zest and magnolia. Medium-full, the wine glides across the palate; there is an extremely lengthy finish that is remarkably polished and sensual. Never overpowering in any aspect, this is as elegant and as understated a release of this wine in several years. Absolutely delicious now, this has the acidity and texture to drink well for many years - a signature of Cristal - with peak in 10-12 years or perhaps a few years longer.

Often, the very survival of a business depends on steady growth. Yet when many companies try to expand, they end up stagnating instead. Expansion problems are both common and various. It can be a new market, vertical, product, or service that just doesn\u2019t work out. As a result, leaders can become timid about further expansion.", "But since standing still is not an option, what\u2019s the trick to successful expansion? Sangram Vajre says it\u2019s knowing when and how to grow. Vajre is the co-founder of Terminus, a go-to-market platform provider founded in 2014 that has since acquired five companies, opened a second office in London, been named an Inc. 5000 company, and surpassed 1,000 customers. Along with his co-author Bryan Brown, Vajre shared a framework for growth in their book, ", "MOVE", ". ", "\u201cThere are three essential ways a company can expand,\u201d Vajre said. \u201cThey are sales, coverage and solutions. Once you know ", "how", " each method works, you can decide ", "when", " to expand.\u201d", "1. Build up sales channels outside your walls", "If you\u2019re a startup with a great product, Vajre said a small, passionate sales team can get on the company on its feet. It can even experience energizing growth by simply expanding its team.", "\u201cEventually, though, things plateau,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can only hire so many salespeople.\u201d", "Direct sales is a good first move, but at some point, Vajre said \u201cyou\u2019ll need to shift your focus to building referral and channel partner programs to avoid the plateau. Investing in external partnerships and network building will help distribute your sales as widely as possible.\u201d", "Vajre points out that many companies have successfully used this model. For example, in 2017, 40 percent of HubSpot\u2019s revenue came from its partner program. Similarly, more than 50 percent of sales for the data warehousing company Snowflake are \u201cpartner-assisted.\u201d", "\u201cDone right, this process incrementally builds capacity outside of your company,\u201d Vajre said. Building and maintaining networks and distribution partners should be an ongoing strategy for any stage in your company\u2019s development. It\u2019s especially critical work, Vajre said, for newer businesses, especially those transitioning out of early ideation stages. ", "\u201cOnce you hit critical capacity without distribution partners in place, no amount of passion or pluck will save your company,\u201d Vajre explained. \u201cThese external channels and networks will also make or break further growth when it\u2019s time to expand coverage and market solutions.\u201d", "Because of this, leaders should have a sound sales expansion strategy in mind as soon as possible, ideally before even bringing products and services to market.", "2. Look to expand coverage in myriad ways", "The second way to grow is through expanded coverage, which Vajre explained can happen in different ways. A company with success in the U.S. might take their products and services to an Asian market, for example. Or they might expand into a different vertical.", "\u201cImagine a company that\u2019s had success in the manufacturing industry,\u201d Vajre said. \u201cThey could expand by marketing to relevant sectors of a related industry, like finance.\u201d", "Finally, Vajre pointed out you can consider moving upmarket (to customers with larger needs and budgets) or downmarket (to those with less complex needs and leaner budgets).", "\u201cThink about Zoom,\u201d Vajre advised. \u201cAfter finding its product fit, it first went upmarket to reach executives. Then, during the pandemic, Zoom became a household name by moving downmarket to address the urgent needs of nonprofits, governments, schools and everyone else.\u201d", "Vajre explained you need a few pieces in place before expanding coverage. First, a solid sales expansion strategy. Second, a revenues team that\u2019s aligned with customer success. Third, you need to have graduated from lead-generation to a successful account-based revenue model.", "\u201cIf those pieces are in place, coverage expansion may be a next viable way to scale,\u201d Vajre said. \u201cWhere you go now depends on product relevance to new market needs, plus opportunities presented by those networks and distribution partners set up through sales expansion.\u201d", "Before making a decision, consider what percentage of your revenue is coming from each coverage area. How can you increase your annual contract value (ACV)? How do you sell multi-year deals? How do you secure prepaid commitments? All of these will allow you to increase the value of your business so you can go to a bigger market and create a larger valuation.", "3. Offer new solutions to existing customers", "The third way to grow is through expanding solutions. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much mileage you can get out of your existing product because you\u2019re trying to sell the same thing to the same customers,\u201d Vajre said. \u201cAlso, as competition or consolidation grows in the market, you face more challenges in differentiating yourself.\u201d", "To become a multi-product company, you must centralize customer success. Gain as much data as possible about your current customers, develop solid account-based marketing and sales operations and make sure new products and services offer solutions your customers need. ", "Let\u2019s return to the example of Zoom, which vastly expanded coverage for one product due to new market demand and the capacity for repeatable, scalable growth. Now, with coverage expansion slowing, it\u2019s increasing its solutions platform by launching new products like Zoom Phone for businesses and adding webinar capabilities.", "Max out the value and optimize operations", "Whether you\u2019re a startup in ideation stage or a thriving, multi-platform company ready to further scale your business, growing pains are real. But Vajre says don\u2019t give up and don\u2019t rely on what worked for others. At the end of the day, only you can determine when and how to grow.", "\u201cYou know your operations and customers best,\u201d he said. \u201cLet that inform which new solutions fit your market, which new categories to move into and when to acquire new companies.\u201d", "A sound sales expansion is key, but this method will only get you so far. So, does your next move involve expanding coverage to new markets, or new solutions for your existing customers? Maybe some combination of the two? Vajre offered a final piece of advice for leaders looking to expand.", "\u201cMake sure you\u2019re maxing out your current value at every stage and that you\u2019ve optimized your operations, he said. \u201cDoing so will help you understand your centre of gravity better than the adjacent category players around you, which leads to smarter expansion decisions.\u201d"]},

When budgets are tight, it makes sense to invest in the efforts that bring in the highest returns. Repeat customers represent remarkable ROI.", "The best thing about a deeply satisfied repeat customer is that they eventually evolve beyond brand advocates and into brand ambassadors, sharing their affinity for your company and its offerings with their own circles of influence. The ripple effect of such affirmative word-of-mouth advertising is worth its weight in gold.", "Getting Pete to Repeat (Purchase) Again", "If you\u2019re an entrepreneur or startup leader who wants to lean into retention efforts and focus more energy on developing brand advocates, there are several action items you can take. Here are three of the best places to start:", "1. Apply elements of neuroscience.", "Believe it or not, our nervous system plays a significant role in our purchasing behaviors. If a product or service actually continues to solve or help avoid a constant pain point, then customers will feel satisfied and safe in making repeat purchases, which are based on the continual confirmation that the promised problem to be solved is actually being solved.", "If I have dandruff and Head & Shoulders shampoo fixes my flakes, my mind connects the product with positive feelings. Backing that experience up with appropriate, persuasive messaging that uses neuroscience to tap into one\u2019s emotions is the best way to ensure repeat customers.", "\u201cHow repeat messages are delivered are also important to repeat purchase; a consumer wants to know they are valued and desired,\u201d says Russell Kern, founder and CEO of ", "KERN", ", an Omnicom digital marketing agency that focuses on delivering personalization at scale that results in continuous customer revenue. \u201cIf the repeat communication lacks relevancy, creativity, or reminders of the gains solved by repurchasing a given product, the consumer will likely switch brands given all the other options available within a given category.\u201d", "2. Use content marketing to educate your consumer.", "Obviously, it\u2019s smart to view customers as the complicated people they are and not just line items on a spreadsheet. To create valuable, long-term relationships with repeat buyers, you\u2019ll need to constantly work on building trust and providing value. The most logical way to do that is by communicating through your content marketing.", "Do you have a company blog or a newsletter that gets sent out at a regular cadence? These are relatively easy ways to keep the conversations going with your existing customer base and offer value-added elements to these relationships. If you\u2019re a lawn-care company, perhaps you post a helpful video that teaches homeowners the best ways to clean out the gutters and downspouts for good home maintenance. You\u2019re limited only by your imagination in the educational content you create.", "Compelling content is pretty much a necessity for any legitimate business in 2022. Did you know that ", "7 in 10 customers", " now prefer to learn about your business through content rather than traditional paid advertising? That percentage will likely only continue to increase as millions more digital natives enter adulthood in the coming years.", "3. Practice excellent customer service.", "Nothing turns a customer\u2019s relationship with a brand sour faster than a bad experience. Have you ever been to a store and not been able to get an associate\u2019s help or spent an hour on the phone only to be disconnected before a resolution was finalized? Did you ever do business with that organization again? Unlikely.", "Because today\u2019s customers have so many options for just about every product and service imaginable, they won\u2019t tolerate a mediocre experience. Your company\u2019s customer service must be so sweet it borders on saccharine. Is Chick-fil-A\u2019s \u201d", "my pleasure", "\u201c mantra over the top? Certainly, at least by some standards. But when you keep going back, it\u2019s not only because of the food quality.

", "Habits are routines of behavior that are repeated regularly and tend to occur subconsciously. They can be created by physiological exposure that shows itself in regularity. However, Wendy Wood, Ph.D., a research ", "psychologist", " at the University of Southern California, said, \"habits function largely outside our conscious awareness because we don't have access to them in the same way we do our feelings, thoughts, and beliefs.\"", "And how we understand habits has deepened over the past century.

", "The Anatomy Of A Habit", "Charles Duhigg, author of ", "The Power of Habit", " says habits can be broken into three parts: trigger, routine, and reward. To develop a habit, there must first be a trigger (or cue). A trigger or cue can be a particular location, time of day, emotion, belief, or people. ", "Once a trigger or cue occurs, a routine follows. For example, every morning when you wake up (trigger or cue), you brew a pot of coffee (routine). Once the coffee is brewed, you receive the reward. Rewards are known to satisfy something you are craving or avoiding. Regarding the coffee example, the reward to your morning coffee routine might be the feeling you get as you drink it, or perhaps the jolt you receive from the caffeine. ", "Brewing coffee might be a positive habit for some, but for others, it may not. The same concept can be applied to other areas of your life\u2014including a not-so-healthy habit like ", "mindless eating", " when you're bored. Ultimately, habits are the products of actions conducted in repetition within a similar context.

Often, the very survival of a business depends on steady growth. Yet when many companies try to expand, they end up stagnating instead. Expansion problems are both common and various. It can be a new market, vertical, product, or service that just doesn\u2019t work out. As a result, leaders can become timid about further expansion.", "But since standing still is not an option, what\u2019s the trick to successful expansion? Sangram Vajre says it\u2019s knowing when and how to grow. Vajre is the co-founder of Terminus, a go-to-market platform provider founded in 2014 that has since acquired five companies, opened a second office in London, been named an Inc. 5000 company, and surpassed 1,000 customers. Along with his co-author Bryan Brown, Vajre shared a framework for growth in their book, ", "MOVE", ". ", "\u201cThere are three essential ways a company can expand,\u201d Vajre said. \u201cThey are sales, coverage and solutions. Once you know ", "how", " each method works, you can decide ", "when", " to expand.\u201d", "1. Build up sales channels outside your walls", "If you\u2019re a startup with a great product, Vajre said a small, passionate sales team can get on the company on its feet. It can even experience energizing growth by simply expanding its team.", "\u201cEventually, though, things plateau,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can only hire so many salespeople.\u201d", "Direct sales is a good first move, but at some point, Vajre said \u201cyou\u2019ll need to shift your focus to building referral and channel partner programs to avoid the plateau. Investing in external partnerships and network building will help distribute your sales as widely as possible.\u201d", "Vajre points out that many companies have successfully used this model. For example, in 2017, 40 percent of HubSpot\u2019s revenue came from its partner program. Similarly, more than 50 percent of sales for the data warehousing company Snowflake are \u201cpartner-assisted.\u201d", "\u201cDone right, this process incrementally builds capacity outside of your company,\u201d Vajre said. Building and maintaining networks and distribution partners should be an ongoing strategy for any stage in your company\u2019s development. It\u2019s especially critical work, Vajre said, for newer businesses, especially those transitioning out of early ideation stages. ", "\u201cOnce you hit critical capacity without distribution partners in place, no amount of passion or pluck will save your company,\u201d Vajre explained. \u201cThese external channels and networks will also make or break further growth when it\u2019s time to expand coverage and market solutions.\u201d", "Because of this, leaders should have a sound sales expansion strategy in mind as soon as possible, ideally before even bringing products and services to market.", "2. Look to expand coverage in myriad ways", "The second way to grow is through expanded coverage, which Vajre explained can happen in different ways. A company with success in the U.S. might take their products and services to an Asian market, for example. Or they might expand into a different vertical.", "\u201cImagine a company that\u2019s had success in the manufacturing industry,\u201d Vajre said. \u201cThey could expand by marketing to relevant sectors of a related industry, like finance.\u201d", "Finally, Vajre pointed out you can consider moving upmarket (to customers with larger needs and budgets) or downmarket (to those with less complex needs and leaner budgets).", "\u201cThink about Zoom,\u201d Vajre advised. \u201cAfter finding its product fit, it first went upmarket to reach executives. Then, during the pandemic, Zoom became a household name by moving downmarket to address the urgent needs of nonprofits, governments, schools and everyone else.\u201d", "Vajre explained you need a few pieces in place before expanding coverage. First, a solid sales expansion strategy. Second, a revenues team that\u2019s aligned with customer success. Third, you need to have graduated from lead-generation to a successful account-based revenue model.", "\u201cIf those pieces are in place, coverage expansion may be a next viable way to scale,\u201d Vajre said. \u201cWhere you go now depends on product relevance to new market needs, plus opportunities presented by those networks and distribution partners set up through sales expansion.\u201d", "Before making a decision, consider what percentage of your revenue is coming from each coverage area. How can you increase your annual contract value (ACV)? How do you sell multi-year deals? How do you secure prepaid commitments? All of these will allow you to increase the value of your business so you can go to a bigger market and create a larger valuation.", "3. Offer new solutions to existing customers", "The third way to grow is through expanding solutions. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much mileage you can get out of your existing product because you\u2019re trying to sell the same thing to the same customers,\u201d Vajre said. \u201cAlso, as competition or consolidation grows in the market, you face more challenges in differentiating yourself.\u201d", "To become a multi-product company, you must centralize customer success. Gain as much data as possible about your current customers, develop solid account-based marketing and sales operations and make sure new products and services offer solutions your customers need. ", "Let\u2019s return to the example of Zoom, which vastly expanded coverage for one product due to new market demand and the capacity for repeatable, scalable growth. Now, with coverage expansion slowing, it\u2019s increasing its solutions platform by launching new products like Zoom Phone for businesses and adding webinar capabilities.", "Max out the value and optimize operations", "Whether you\u2019re a startup in ideation stage or a thriving, multi-platform company ready to further scale your business, growing pains are real. But Vajre says don\u2019t give up and don\u2019t rely on what worked for others. At the end of the day, only you can determine when and how to grow.", "\u201cYou know your operations and customers best,\u201d he said. \u201cLet that inform which new solutions fit your market, which new categories to move into and when to acquire new companies.\u201d", "A sound sales expansion is key, but this method will only get you so far. So, does your next move involve expanding coverage to new markets, or new solutions for your existing customers? Maybe some combination of the two? Vajre offered a final piece of advice for leaders looking to expand.", "\u201cMake sure you\u2019re maxing out your current value at every stage and that you\u2019ve optimized your operations, he said. \u201cDoing so will help you understand your centre of gravity better than the adjacent category players around you, which leads to smarter expansion decisions.\u201d"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/", "author_name": null, "author_contrib_type": null, "author_subcontext_header": null, "author_about": "", "author_social_links": []}},

Use content marketing to educate your consumer.", "Obviously, it\u2019s smart to view customers as the complicated people they are and not just line items on a spreadsheet. To create valuable, long-term relationships with repeat buyers, you\u2019ll need to constantly work on building trust and providing value. The most logical way to do that is by communicating through your content marketing.", "Do you have a company blog or a newsletter that gets sent out at a regular cadence?

A more permanent way out of chronic world hunger would be creating more options in more places to grow and access food. Organic farming also shows glimmers of growth, but still accounts for less of 1% of agricultural acreage in the U.S.", "Then there\u2019s the problem of getting food to people who are in some cases so hungry they\u2019re starving. Before the war in Ukraine, 26 million refugees, the highest level in history, relied on a network of aid and government organizations for food. Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine has displaced or made refugees of another estimated 10 million.

Lebanon imports about half its wheat from Ukraine, the organization said. For Tunisia, the percentage is 42% and for Yemen 22%.

Farmers in places like the U.S. and Brazil are already farming as much as they can. Agriculture requires long-term planning far ahead of a planting season, and companies and organizations purchase food months if not years in advance. Direct contracts with suppliers give growers even less leeway on what crops to raise. That\u2019s why ending the global food shortage is far from as simple as American or Brazilian farmers planting more wheat or corn.", "The high cost of fertilizer has also put a drag on global agriculture. Nitrogen fertilizer prices have increased four-fold, while phosphate and potash prices have climbed more than three-fold since 2020. Nutrien said it\u2019s expanding its mining in Southern Canada for potash, an essential source of potassium, to help offset what could be a gaping global shortfall due to sanctions on Russia, a big exporter.", "Proponents of industrial agriculture say chemical fertilizers are necessary to harvest large yields and feed a growing global population. Fertilizer overuse, however, is a leading cause of waterway pollution and dead zones like the massive one in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as soil degradation and erosion.

Each could arguably be taught in a week instead of months or years, as exemplified by educators who award digital badges to workers for such courses which send them toward lucrative careers with modest effort and investment.

Extreme weather, such as persistent drought in North America, high fuel costs, fertilizer prices through the roof and the need to feed an increasing number of refugees displaced by war and climate change will contribute to the menace of growing hunger in 2022. ", "\u201cThe situation is in many ways bordering on catastrophic, and without substantial and immediate assistance, it will get worse,\u201d said Eric Mu\u00f1oz, senior policy advisor for agriculture at Oxfam, the Nairobi-based charity. \u201cThere\u2019s no better wake-up call than the current moment, with sky-high food prices and skyrocketing hunger, to have a serious conversation about rethinking global food systems.\u201d", "Short-term solutions are hard to come by. American farmers, hobbled by what some observers are calling the driest weather in ", "1,200 years", ", can\u2019t be depended on to make up for the shortfall. Nutrien, the world\u2019s biggest fertilizer maker, has said it plans to ramp up production by 20%, but prices have been so high that a lot of the world\u2019s growers still won\u2019t be able to afford it. A more permanent way out of chronic world hunger would be creating more options in more places to grow and access food. Organic farming also shows glimmers of growth, but still accounts for less of 1% of agricultural acreage in the U.S.", "Then there\u2019s the problem of getting food to people who are in some cases so hungry they\u2019re starving. Before the war in Ukraine, 26 million refugees, the highest level in history, relied on a network of aid and government organizations for food. Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine has displaced or made refugees of another estimated 10 million. The World Food Programme, the UN\u2019s food-assistance branch, expects its costs to rise $71 million a month due to the conflict alone. The organization says it has already had to reduce rations in hunger-stricken Yemen, where it says more than 16 million people are food insecure and \u201cthere are pockets of famine-like conditions.\u201d ", "The Middle East and North Africa are particularly vulnerable to higher food prices, according to the World Food Programme. Lebanon imports about half its wheat from Ukraine, the organization said. For Tunisia, the percentage is 42% and for Yemen 22%. Food prices worldwide are already at an all-time high, and buyers that need to shop around to replace Ukrainian wheat would pay even more, the organization said. Russia has already curtailed wheat and maize exports, and Ukraine\u2019s agricultural minister said Tuesday that its spring crop could be as small as half what the country expected before the invasion. Ukraine has suspended exports of meat, livestock, salt, sugar, buckwheat, oats, millet and rye.", "In 2010, skyrocketing bread prices contributed to the political uprisings of the Arab Spring, which swept through some three dozen countries and forced regime change in Egypt and Libya. Protests against high food prices also played a part in the rise of the violent Islamic State extremist group. The current global food supply is not as bad as in 2010 \u2014 when total food supplies were even lower \u2014 but the global grain supply is now in a critical situation. ", "U.S. farmers are hamstrung when it comes to filling the gap in food production. First, there\u2019s the historically lousy weather. Thirty-five states, or 61% of the total acreage of the lower 48 states, were in ", "drought", " last week, according to government calculations. Extreme or severe dry conditions persist from the Pacific coast in the West to as far as Louisiana and Arkansas in the East. ", "Then there\u2019s the availability of land. Farmers in places like the U.S. and Brazil are already farming as much as they can. Agriculture requires long-term planning far ahead of a planting season, and companies and organizations purchase food months if not years in advance. Direct contracts with suppliers give growers even less leeway on what crops to raise. That\u2019s why ending the global food shortage is far from as simple as American or Brazilian farmers planting more wheat or corn.", "The high cost of fertilizer has also put a drag on global agriculture. Nitrogen fertilizer prices have increased four-fold, while phosphate and potash prices have climbed more than three-fold since 2020. Nutrien said it\u2019s expanding its mining in Southern Canada for potash, an essential source of potassium, to help offset what could be a gaping global shortfall due to sanctions on Russia, a big exporter.", "Proponents of industrial agriculture say chemical fertilizers are necessary to harvest large yields and feed a growing global population. Fertilizer overuse, however, is a leading cause of waterway pollution and dead zones like the massive one in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as soil degradation and erosion. Those are all factors which will challenge access to food in the future, and advocates of sustainable agriculture say now is the time to make the transition to more resilient systems. ", "\u201cThese are all price signals that show the world is telling us to change,\u201d said Sanjeev Krishnan, the chief investment officer at venture firm S2G, which is backed by Walmart heir Lukas Walton and has invested in food and agriculture since 2014. \u201cIs this cyclical or structural? In my opinion, it\u2019s structural.\u201d", "Just as fertilizer prices were starting to spike, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would create a $250 million fund to invest in alternative and U.S.-made fertilizers. The government of Brazil, which has imported a lot of fertilizer from Russia, is also investing in alternatives. Meanwhile, earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron signaled support for more investment in food infrastructure. ", "\u201cEurope and also Africa will be very deeply destabilized in regards to food because of what can\u2019t be planted right now in Ukraine,\u201d Macron said March 11. \u201cWe will have to prepare for that and reevaluate our production strategies to defend our food sovereignty, but also to be able to define a strategy concerning Africa.\u201d", "Food security should have the same priority as energy security, said Graham Gordon, U.K.-based head of policy at the nonprofit Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, the world\u2019s second-biggest humanitarian network after the Red Cross.

Historically, these have been near impossible to learn, have horrible user interfaces, and the machines refuse to talk to each other, so you need as many of them as you have machines. If a factory floor is a cacophony of spouses trying to get their points across, this machinery is the arbiter who has not even bothered to show up. The MIT study suggests investing in skills and training. Maybe so, but could that not be wasteful, too? ", "Consider that most of the manufacturing sector consists of SME companies, each with day-to-day concerns that far outshine corporate imperatives to invest in technology and re-train their workers. There\u2019s trouble within this situation, and policymakers, although well-meaning, would have us believe we have a massive re-skilling challenge on our hands. ", "It\u2019s worth asking if the technology used for upskilling, or more importantly the technology we skill for, benefits the workforce. After all, why would the training be made so difficult in the first place? Experts claim it could take thirty years to upskill Ohio and Michigan\u2019s manufacturing bases, let alone those in Africa, South America, or Asia.", "No company should be allowed to put overly complex technology in place. Unfortunately, there are no regulations to outlaw complexity, even if technology is tricky-to-use, too challenging to learn, and incapable of communicating with older generations. Operators trained in a day cannot run this machinery. At a minimum, there could be UX designers on the job to certify the tech for use in the factory. A moratorium on bad technology could perhaps bring some shopfloors to a halt while invigorating others? ", "All that being said, what would the remaining curriculum look like? Still needed: a core competency in management frameworks, technologies (e.g. Additive/3D/4D, AI/ML, Edge/IoT/Sensors, Industrial production systems, No-code software, Robotics systems), industrial operations platforms, and digitally enhanced operational practices, to name a few. Each could arguably be taught in a week instead of months or years, as exemplified by educators who award digital badges to workers for such courses which send them toward lucrative careers with modest effort and investment. Right now, these ideas are limited by the poor state of factory floors, well-intentioned but stodgy educational institutions, and the lack of curated training paths. ", "Industrial tech has become too complex, and industry 4.0 will soon lose relevance without providing the value expected, even if the implementation strategy gets perfected. Perhaps though, the workforce and the economy will be better for it. The \u201cGerman envy\u201d the US has been displaying is not helping us along. It may be as simple as pulling off the band aid. What if the States were to develop a pragmatic, simple, and next-generation Lean approach that will not take decades to implement?

Now, rather than having to inspect each ball bearing individually to ensure it is the perfect size for the job, we can be certain of specifications by referencing a digital twin containing its exact measurements. Rather than send back an entire set of ball bearings due to a single failure, we can reference a part number to the supplier, have that supplier pull up the conditions under which that ball bearing was created, and pinpoint any others in the set that may be at similar risk.", "Of course, this one instance is just scratching the surface of what digital twins can do for manufacturers. There are supreme implications for productivity and quality.", "If we know the specific details of a given part and its usage history, we can take into account even the smallest defects that part develops and create programs that automatically rewrite themselves to account for imperfections.

", "Case managers assisting people with their return to work at Allsup Employment Services (AES) frequently see that people will choose service or sales positions, with fewer returning to management or executive-level roles. One of the primary factors in this choice can be that people who experience a disability can lose confidence in their ability to tackle the same level of responsibility they previously worked. This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising considering some individuals may be recovering from brain injuries, spinal injuries or conditions like stroke and heart attack. ", "Some individuals may believe a service-oriented job is more manageable. It\u2019s possible they may identify these jobs with more flexible work hours as well, and this is where AES case managers can make a difference. It\u2019s the responsibility of case managers to encourage job seekers and bolster their confidence to get them to return to a professional job. So, this is a great time for a coachable moment with candidates. We let them know, \u201cHey, you can do this.\u201d Many times, that simple vote of confidence from an advocate is all a candidate needs to step forward and own their abilities. ", "An Eye For Transferable Skills When Returning to Work", "One of the ways case managers provide direction is to evaluate the person\u2019s job history in order to identify transferable skills. What skills does a candidate have that are transferrable to office or professional work? Case managers coach individuals on acknowledging and applying these skills to their job search in order to build their confidence for returning to work in these capacities. ", "One example of transferable skills are the skills of a commercially licensed truck driver. They may not be physically able to continue as a driver, but because of their specialized knowledge of the industry and their experience as a driver, they may be a great fit to work in a dispatch position. For the candidate, it\u2019s a great way to reconnect with a world that they know intimately and to help others navigate \u2013 literally.", "Another way case managers guide clients is to check in with them about their likes, dislikes and prior experiences. When a client isn\u2019t confident about what kind of work they want to do, AES case managers ask them two important questions: What do you want to do? And what do you like to do? Marrying these two together with the job candidates\u2019 past work and knowledge helps case managers find a good fit for them now. ", "One of our successful job candidates at AES had formerly worked as a nurse. She couldn\u2019t do the heavy lifting she had previously done. One of her favorite things about nursing was the human contact and helping others she experienced. We assisted her in her job search and she landed a position at a plasma clinic working to screen clients. The employer needed someone with the skills and education of a nurse, but no heavy lifting was required. The new employee was still able to experience the human interaction she so enjoyed. Since starting in the role, she loves this job and it\u2019s a great fit for longevity. ", "Finding New Talent Based On Former Skills ", "For hiring managers and employers, it may seem overwhelming at times to find new talent for your organization. Employers who partner with case managers like those employed by AES can find and retain valuable new employees. Considering factors like transferrable job skills and past experience are simple steps that vastly improve your ability to find qualified, experienced workers. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicates, people returning to the workforce after a disability can provide you with an untapped market that you can call upon to revitalize your workforce and diversify your company\u2019s culture."]},

", "If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is the power and potential of technology to enable connection. From video conferencing to grocery shopping on our phones, innovations in technology and communication have allowed people around the world to connect and collaborate virtually in new ways over the past two years.

According to the United Nations, communication is a fundamental human right and for many people with disabilities it is often only possible to communicate digitally. ", "Thankfully, in recent years, there have been some major inclusion breakthroughs when it comes to digital communications, which have massively benefited the disabled community. Software advances such as captioning features on video conferencing platforms like Microsoft Teams and social media platforms like Instagram have enabled making calls and watching videos online more accessible to the D/deaf communities. ", "In May 2021, tech giant Apple also launched a series of powerful new software features designed for people with mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive disabilities, including a new service called SignTime, which enables customers to communicate with AppleCare and Retail Customer Care by using sign language, right in their web browsers. Among Apple\u2019s other updates were AssistiveTouch for Apple Watch to support users with limited mobility, and VoiceOver, an industry-leading screen reader for blind and low vision communities.

Major technology companies have been working with hearing aid designers to ensure their handsets are compatible with the hearing aids that people rely on every day. ", "Other hardware developments include smart glasses, which use a camera and connectivity to bring assistance to people with visual impairments. Brands such as AIRA use trained assistants to provide spoken feedback about what the user is looking at, effectively offering a pair of eyes to guide people through unfamiliar routes, indoor surroundings or outfits.", "However, while innovations like these can foster inclusion, it is equally important that digital communications technology doesn\u2019t conversely create barriers for people with disabilities. ", "Recently, the GSMA, the industry organization representing the interests of mobile providers, released a report revealing that the global disabled community have lower levels of mobile ownership than their non-disabled counterparts. The research found that the disability gap typically widens at each stage of the mobile internet journey. In almost all the countries surveyed, disabled users were more likely to own basic phones, which have either no or fewer built-in accessibility features and may not be internet-enabled. In September, the World Economic Forum also published the revelation that Americans with disabilities are three times more likely to never go online than those without a disability (15% vs. 5%). ", "Lack of accessibility of online services is another key problem facing the disabled community. Whilst the internet can enable easier access to banking, healthcare, employment, and entertainment, a lack of accessibility excludes people with disabilities from these fundamental services. At a time when the pandemic has accelerated digital transformations across the globe, it is more essential than ever that tech companies continue to adapt to include the disabled population. In June 2020, a review of 10,000,000 websites carried out by accessiBe found that 98 percent of menus and 71 percent of online forms failed to meet accessibility guidelines. ", "This is a problem Verizon is trying to solve by cofounding Teach Access, a coalition of top tech companies, major universities, and leading advocacy organizations on a mission to infuse accessibility concepts and skills into higher education curriculums. Together, they empower students studying design, computer science, and human-computer interaction with the knowledge necessary to create a more inclusive and accessible world. Talking about the programme CEO of Verizon, Hans Vestberg, said accessibility has \u201cbeen in our genes and in our values for a long time and of course we\u2019re trying to get better all the time, learn all the time.\u201d ", "Another key problem is lack of access to assistive technology such as screen-readers, adaptive keyboards and pointing devices. Although the use of digital Assistive Technology is proven to enhance the independence and productivity of disabled people, many people with disabilities are not able to benefit from it. The GSMA estimates that approximately 90 percent of the global population do not have adequate access to the assistive technologies (AT) they require. This is due to a number of factors such as cost and lack of awareness. ", "Mats Granryd, director general of the GSMA, said \u201cMobile connectivity is a massive enabler to reach the sustainable development goals. People living with a disability face obstacles that could be overcome with technology that better serves them. It can play a major role in ensuring that people feel part of the community and ultimately can contribute more to society.\u201d ", "We need to demand mobile providers realize the benefits of designing with inclusion and accessibility in mind using people with disabilities in the process. This is no longer about realizing a market worth $13 trillion every year, made up from the disposal income of people with disabilities and their friends and family, - it\u2019s about future proofing and the risk to businesses of failing to act. Designing for people with disabilities means better design for everyone and the benefits are huge. It\u2019s important not to forget that so much of the technology we take for granted today was originally designed with disability in mind. The typewriter, the ancestor of modern keyboards, was created to enable blind people to type, while the remote control was designed to make television more accessible to people with limited mobility. And speech-to-text and voice recognition software? You\u2019ve got it \u2013 that was originally designed for people with disabilities too. ", "When we design technology to be accessible, we drive innovation and lay the path for the next generation of progress. We need the mobile and technology industries to act as a force for enabling and driving inclusion, to create a better world for all. ", "The foe to this debate is often how easily forgotten the disability community is. How many podcasts, a popular go-to for many, do not include subtitles or transcripts which means they\u2019re excluding an entire audience. ", "Its shocking to look at public announcements by government officials, that do not provide sign language. The technology and solutions exist but are not always embraced. There is a similar story in the business world where utilizing these types of solutions can be overlooked, or seen as an added cost or another job on top of many other things to deliver. In many situations, it\u2019s just not thought about. We need to move to a culture where accessibility is included as part of everyday life, so when you next go on a Teams call make sure everyone is aware of the transcript option.

It means that policymakers should explicitly state the goal of student loan cancellation. Is student loan cancellation only to help current student loan borrowers? Is it ongoing student loan relief?

While the government subsidizes public colleges and universities, many Americans pay for college by borrowing student loans. (", "Biden has cancelled $15 billion of student loans", "). As King notes, should the government increase funding for Pell Grants? Should public colleges and universities, including community colleges, be free through subsidies from the federal government? Biden has pitched this idea, as has Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). If policymakers decide to cancel student loans, the real question is who will pay for college in the future? If the plan is for the government to provide free higher education for all Americans, policymakers should discuss student loan cancellation and free college as a combined plan to provide transparency.

What are policymakers doing to address the cost of higher education? Americans are burdened with student loan debt because college and graduate school are costly. Federal student loan debt is widely available to virtually anyone who wants a student loan. The rationale is to create educational opportunities for all and reduce disparities, both of which are essential goals. At the same time, many 17-year-olds who borrow student loans to attend college won\u2019t understand their future monthly student loan payments or their ability to pay off student loans. What are policymakers doing to address these issues? Anyone who wants an education should have an opportunity to pursue one.

The research found that the disability gap typically widens at each stage of the mobile internet journey. In almost all the countries surveyed, disabled users were more likely to own basic phones, which have either no or fewer built-in accessibility features and may not be internet-enabled. In September, the World Economic Forum also published the revelation that Americans with disabilities are three times more likely to never go online than those without a disability (15% vs. 5%). ", "Lack of accessibility of online services is another key problem facing the disabled community. Whilst the internet can enable easier access to banking, healthcare, employment, and entertainment, a lack of accessibility excludes people with disabilities from these fundamental services. At a time when the pandemic has accelerated digital transformations across the globe, it is more essential than ever that tech companies continue to adapt to include the disabled population. In June 2020, a review of 10,000,000 websites carried out by accessiBe found that 98 percent of menus and 71 percent of online forms failed to meet accessibility guidelines.

Although the use of digital Assistive Technology is proven to enhance the independence and productivity of disabled people, many people with disabilities are not able to benefit from it. The GSMA estimates that approximately 90 percent of the global population do not have adequate access to the assistive technologies (AT) they require. This is due to a number of factors such as cost and lack of awareness.

Designing for people with disabilities means better design for everyone and the benefits are huge. It\u2019s important not to forget that so much of the technology we take for granted today was originally designed with disability in mind. The typewriter, the ancestor of modern keyboards, was created to enable blind people to type, while the remote control was designed to make television more accessible to people with limited mobility. And speech-to-text and voice recognition software? You\u2019ve got it \u2013 that was originally designed for people with disabilities too.

We need the mobile and technology industries to act as a force for enabling and driving inclusion, to create a better world for all.

How many podcasts, a popular go-to for many, do not include subtitles or transcripts which means they\u2019re excluding an entire audience.

Her clothing brands sought to produce sizes for all bodies, and her makeup line launched with dozens of shades of foundation, which thrilled everyone seeking out traditionally hard-to-find darker foundation colors. Rihanna said at the Fenty Beauty launch, \u201cIn every product I was like, \u2018There needs to be something for a dark-skinned girl; there needs to be something for a really pale girl; there needs to be something in-between\u2019...you want people to appreciate the product and not feel like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s cute, but it only looks good on her\u2019.\u201d Darker tones in the collection sold out right away. This proves that not only is inclusion the right thing to do in a 2021 world, but that being truly inclusive of as many of your potential customers as possible ", "sells", ".", "2) Personalize your products.", "One of Rihanna\u2019s real strengths in her branding is in creating products and product lines that feel personalized, both for the consumer buying them and in relating to Rihanna\u2019s own background and style. Rihanna is vulnerable in sharing what inspires her from her childhood in Barbados when talking about launching her makeup line in ", "an interview", ", saying \u201cWhen I was a teen back in Barbados, I was in a pageant, and my mom did my makeup for it. I will never forget the feeling I had after seeing how even my skin looked when she put foundation on my face.I loved it. It\u2019s like Photoshop. I like my makeup to look like skin\u2014really good skin. [My mom] worked behind a cosmetics counter at a department store in Barbados, and she did makeup for weddings. That\u2019s where my obsession for cosmetics and perfume came from, but I wasn\u2019t allowed to wear makeup unless it was for a special occasion.\u201d This vulnerability makes her audience feel connected to her as person and helps make her products feel personalized and relatable.", "3) Leverage your audience for new ventures.", "Rihanna could have been content to create popular music and walk red carpets throughout her career. She certainly could have made an entire career and fortune from just those things. Instead, she chose to leverage her mega-fame into brand new ventures across industries. Rihanna has a stunning 110 million followers on Instagram and 103 million on Twitter, which she has turned into an incredibly loyal brand following. Her die-hard fans have even dubbed themselves the \u201cRihanna Navy,\u201d which may sound extreme, but has compelled her new brand ventures to sky-high success.", "As Rihanna\u2019s personal brand catapults to greater and greater heights, her net worth continues to rise and there are valuable lessons for everyone. Whether it is understanding that true inclusion sells, being careful to personalize every product, or knowing how to leverage fans and superfans to support new ventures, every brand can learn from Rihanna\u2019s incredible success."], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/goldiechan/", "author_name": "Goldie Chan", "author_contrib_type": "Contributor", "author_subcontext_header": "Careers", "author_about": "I'm a personal branding expert, digital strategist and creative.

To satisfy ESG investors\u2019 desire to better see where companies stand in the fight against climate catastrophe, the top U.S. financial regulator is now proposing the most sweeping addition to corporate disclosure in years \u2014 requiring public companies to calculate for investors how environmentally sound their practices are.", "One sticking point: Under certain circumstances,", " ", "corporations will also be required to disclose the environmental impact of companies they do business with.", "\u201cThe proposal turns the disclosure regime on its head,\u201d said Hester Peirce, the lone Republican on the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is proposing the requirement. \u201cCurrent SEC disclosure mandates are intended to provide investors with an accurate picture of the company\u2019s present and prospective performance through managers\u2019 own eyes.

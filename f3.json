Still others, who have art, whether they are collectors, investors or artists, are enjoying the significantly above market returns that artwork is generating. The result is that art is being bought by people across the wealth spectrum, from the ultra-high net worth collectors, to the Millennial looking to invest a few thousand dollars. Regardless of their level of wealth, art collectors who buy art directly are highly fee-conscious individuals. ", " More often than not, once they acquire art, their approach is a \u201cdo-it-yourself (DIY)\u201d for managing the art. The problem is that the scope of management always broadens, so much so that using DIY management creates a number of problems, including: ", "You cannot insure making optimal decisions because of the difficulty seeing (or remembering) the big picture: the family/market/cultural environment that the collection exists within, as well as the social, economic and regulatory environment around you.", "Your schedule becomes burdened by matters that can be handled better and more efficiently through delegation.", "You put time and energy into making important decisions only to have the ball dropped on executing the critical administrative details because, ultimately, your DIY approach makes you responsible for chasing all the details; and, details will fall through the cracks.", "You take action only when a situation has developed or opportunities have been missed, because you are reluctant to \u201cstart the clock\u201d on hourly billing or other fees.", " If, not when, something happens to you, as the one responsible for the management for the art, there is no clear succession on who has access to information nor is there time for successors to fully understand the situation.", " Traditionally, the alternatives proposed to the DIY Artist or Collector for management of their collection too often is either to sell the collection or transfer ownership and control of artwork to a non-profit entity - either a public charity or an operating private foundation. Without understanding the bigger picture, these alternatives may not be the best option for the Artist, Collector, their heirs or fiduciaries.", " Planning promotes consistent decision-making and minimizes missed opportunity problems. Administration resolves the issue of poor execution; while, leadership provides the continuity of ownership and minimizes risks on an outsource basis. More significantly, planning for the Artist, Collector or Family Office, prevents them from being forced to give up ownership of the collection in order to preserve it. ", " Management of artwork and other collectibles can be simplified by aggregating assets based on the role that the owner plays for income tax purposes and the owner\u2019s goals in life and at death. Further, to manage collections effectively, you need access to perceptive market analysis with the ability to sort significant trends from fads; expertise with income and estate taxes peculiar to tangible assets; and, last but not least, you need to be sensitive to the feelings and emotions that are unique to the Collector and heirs. ", " All this makes for a tall order. Seeking specialized expertise in advance is probably the only way for the typical Collector or Artist to maximize the value of his or her collection. ", "Inventory Your Collection", " Most collectors do not have a current inventory of their assets; or if the inventory does exist, it is lacking critical information or is in a format that is cryptic in the extreme. Inventories in the estate often are geared towards minimizing the estate tax value of the asset, and are rarely complete or sufficiently detailed. Inventories can sometimes be confusing, because artists often work and collect artwork in many different media, making it difficult to determine who created what artworks in the collection. Therefore, you will need expert assistance to describe assets for the inventory. At the minimum, inventories should include: ", "List of works created by an artist and in your possession;", "Authors (including joint authors and collaborations and contact information);", "Dates of both creation and acquisition;", "Contracts associated with any works, such as licenses, assignments, etc.;", "Where the items are located;", "Galleries or dealer names, along with their contact information; and, any paperwork that refers to the artwork, such as catalogs, bills of sale and so forth.", "Whether you use a spread sheet, a software program or even old-fashioned card catalog system, beginning an inventory is critical.", " Include in the inventory any reference to contractual relationships that might exist, including consignment agreements, copyrights, distributions and reproduction rights. Remember that ownership of artwork does not convey the copyright to that artwork. In some countries, artists retain certain rights over the transfer and display of art, even after sale.", "Aggregate your Collection", " ", " Even when all of the significant artwork is clearly inventoried, researched, labeled and stored, you will most likely be confronted with a large number of items, not only easily recognizable valuable art, but coins, gemstones, jewelry, furniture or other collectables. Each collection of items has associated masses of documents, catalogs, notes, letters, bills of sale and paperwork. Although it does not seem like much, a single piece of paperwork can be critical for determining the provenance (and therefore value) of an item. In order to support your new collections of items, each with many different taxes, provenance and valuation issues, you must simplify.", " A critical first step to simplification is aggregating items and their associated paperwork. Items with similar characteristics are formed into groups and these groups are given certain rules or guidelines based on trends in the art market, the tax consequences of buying or selling, and most importantly, as your desires.", "Manage your Collection", " Usually, only the collector plays an active role in the buying and selling of art and other collectibles. Advisors and professionals must support you in managing your collections. As part of that management, they will need help finding the professionals with the proper expertise and experience to manage the collection. Outside expertise must work within the collectors financial and legal affairs to coordinate tangible asset management with the investment management of the family wealth - in both routine and in crisis situations - without the high price tag of bringing these specialized services in-house. These professionals provide the collector the \u201crolling chassis\u201d of inventory, aggregation, valuation, storage and management of the collection.", " The remarkable \u201cstickiness\u201d of individual ownership of collectibles, encourages a long-term understanding and education of how the collectible fits into the overall collection. The financial profit from the immediate sale of a collection may far exceed the comparable profit on an alternative investment. Emotional, personal and social \u201creturn\u201d on the actual ownership of the collectible, often trumps the financial rewards; and, the desire for both the collector and their heirs is that the collection will not be sold. Indeed, far from having to be cautious of \u201cpassive\u201d investors in art, collectors often become too personally active and emotionally involved in the ownership of the items. Collectors have more expertise and knowledge about their areas of interest than do most of the professional advisers available to \u201cmanage\u201d the collection. The result is that, rather than having professionals compensated directly for their management expertise and access to the collectible markets, they are paid for the curatorial, research and organizational services. ", " It is this stickiness that ultimately causes the most problems when managfing an art collection like an alternative investment. Invstors are less likely to have a personal or emotional bond with thelr limited partnership interests in a hedge fund as much as a collector as with an art object.

But until then,\u00a0it\u2019s best to remember that he gave away the largest amount he\u2019s ever given the same year that he sold the most Tesla stock and exercised the most Tesla options ever. As a result, the reason for the stock gift probably had more to do with lowering his tax bill than anything else.

She began practicing landscape architecture in New York in 1895, finding clients among her mother\u2019s and aunt\u2019s social connections. Her work soon attracted notice and she became the first consulting landscape architect at Yale University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and other schools. She designed the original East Garden at the White House (famously redesigned by Bunny Mellon and Melania Trump.)

Others are picking potential winners in the new ", "NFT art market", ". Still others, who have art, whether they are collectors, investors or artists, are enjoying the significantly above market returns that artwork is generating. The result is that art is being bought by people across the wealth spectrum, from the ultra-high net worth collectors, to the Millennial looking to invest a few thousand dollars. Regardless of their level of wealth, art collectors who buy art directly are highly fee-conscious individuals. ", " More often than not, once they acquire art, their approach is a \u201cdo-it-yourself (DIY)\u201d for managing the art. The problem is that the scope of management always broadens, so much so that using DIY management creates a number of problems, including: ", "You cannot insure making optimal decisions because of the difficulty seeing (or remembering) the big picture: the family/market/cultural environment that the collection exists within, as well as the social, economic and regulatory environment around you.", "Your schedule becomes burdened by matters that can be handled better and more efficiently through delegation.", "You put time and energy into making important decisions only to have the ball dropped on executing the critical administrative details because, ultimately, your DIY approach makes you responsible for chasing all the details; and, details will fall through the cracks.", "You take action only when a situation has developed or opportunities have been missed, because you are reluctant to \u201cstart the clock\u201d on hourly billing or other fees.", " If, not when, something happens to you, as the one responsible for the management for the art, there is no clear succession on who has access to information nor is there time for successors to fully understand the situation.", " Traditionally, the alternatives proposed to the DIY Artist or Collector for management of their collection too often is either to sell the collection or transfer ownership and control of artwork to a non-profit entity - either a public charity or an operating private foundation. Without understanding the bigger picture, these alternatives may not be the best option for the Artist, Collector, their heirs or fiduciaries.", " Planning promotes consistent decision-making and minimizes missed opportunity problems. Administration resolves the issue of poor execution; while, leadership provides the continuity of ownership and minimizes risks on an outsource basis. More significantly, planning for the Artist, Collector or Family Office, prevents them from being forced to give up ownership of the collection in order to preserve it. ", " Management of artwork and other collectibles can be simplified by aggregating assets based on the role that the owner plays for income tax purposes and the owner\u2019s goals in life and at death. Further, to manage collections effectively, you need access to perceptive market analysis with the ability to sort significant trends from fads; expertise with income and estate taxes peculiar to tangible assets; and, last but not least, you need to be sensitive to the feelings and emotions that are unique to the Collector and heirs. ", " All this makes for a tall order. Seeking specialized expertise in advance is probably the only way for the typical Collector or Artist to maximize the value of his or her collection. ", "Inventory Your Collection", " Most collectors do not have a current inventory of their assets; or if the inventory does exist, it is lacking critical information or is in a format that is cryptic in the extreme. Inventories in the estate often are geared towards minimizing the estate tax value of the asset, and are rarely complete or sufficiently detailed. Inventories can sometimes be confusing, because artists often work and collect artwork in many different media, making it difficult to determine who created what artworks in the collection. Therefore, you will need expert assistance to describe assets for the inventory. At the minimum, inventories should include: ", "List of works created by an artist and in your possession;", "Authors (including joint authors and collaborations and contact information);", "Dates of both creation and acquisition;", "Contracts associated with any works, such as licenses, assignments, etc.;", "Where the items are located;", "Galleries or dealer names, along with their contact information; and, any paperwork that refers to the artwork, such as catalogs, bills of sale and so forth.", "Whether you use a spread sheet, a software program or even old-fashioned card catalog system, beginning an inventory is critical.", " Include in the inventory any reference to contractual relationships that might exist, including consignment agreements, copyrights, distributions and reproduction rights. Remember that ownership of artwork does not convey the copyright to that artwork. In some countries, artists retain certain rights over the transfer and display of art, even after sale.", "Aggregate your Collection", " ", " Even when all of the significant artwork is clearly inventoried, researched, labeled and stored, you will most likely be confronted with a large number of items, not only easily recognizable valuable art, but coins, gemstones, jewelry, furniture or other collectables. Each collection of items has associated masses of documents, catalogs, notes, letters, bills of sale and paperwork. Although it does not seem like much, a single piece of paperwork can be critical for determining the provenance (and therefore value) of an item. In order to support your new collections of items, each with many different taxes, provenance and valuation issues, you must simplify.", " A critical first step to simplification is aggregating items and their associated paperwork. Items with similar characteristics are formed into groups and these groups are given certain rules or guidelines based on trends in the art market, the tax consequences of buying or selling, and most importantly, as your desires.", "Manage your Collection", " Usually, only the collector plays an active role in the buying and selling of art and other collectibles. Advisors and professionals must support you in managing your collections. As part of that management, they will need help finding the professionals with the proper expertise and experience to manage the collection. Outside expertise must work within the collectors financial and legal affairs to coordinate tangible asset management with the investment management of the family wealth - in both routine and in crisis situations - without the high price tag of bringing these specialized services in-house. These professionals provide the collector the \u201crolling chassis\u201d of inventory, aggregation, valuation, storage and management of the collection.", " The remarkable \u201cstickiness\u201d of individual ownership of collectibles, encourages a long-term understanding and education of how the collectible fits into the overall collection. The financial profit from the immediate sale of a collection may far exceed the comparable profit on an alternative investment. Emotional, personal and social \u201creturn\u201d on the actual ownership of the collectible, often trumps the financial rewards; and, the desire for both the collector and their heirs is that the collection will not be sold. Indeed, far from having to be cautious of \u201cpassive\u201d investors in art, collectors often become too personally active and emotionally involved in the ownership of the items. Collectors have more expertise and knowledge about their areas of interest than do most of the professional advisers available to \u201cmanage\u201d the collection. The result is that, rather than having professionals compensated directly for their management expertise and access to the collectible markets, they are paid for the curatorial, research and organizational services. ", " It is this stickiness that ultimately causes the most problems when managfing an art collection like an alternative investment. Invstors are less likely to have a personal or emotional bond with thelr limited partnership interests in a hedge fund as much as a collector as with an art object.

The timing tracks: A month prior to the November share transfer, Musk ", "tweeted", " that he\u2019d donate $6 billion to the WFP\u2014if the organization could describe \u201cexactly how $6B will solve world hunger.\u201d (Some surmised that Musk, who has ", "a long history", " of tweeting flippantly, was simply ", "trolling", ".) But the WFP has not received such a gift, it told ", "Forbes ", "on Tuesday. \u201cWhether WFP receives any of this money is yet to be seen, but I am excited to hear that Elon is engaged,\u201d said the organization's Executive Director David Beasley in a statement. No other charities have announced gifts yet, either, and Musk did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\u00a0", "What makes a lot more sense is that the money landed in a donor-advised fund (DAF), which behaves like a philanthropic bank account. DAFs are essentially black boxes, since they don\u2019t carry specific requirements like annual distributions or public disclosures of grants tied to a specific donor. Money can sit in DAFs for years without ever going to an operating nonprofit group, which is why ", "Forbes", " does not count such funds when measuring the biggest philanthropists\u2014unless the billionaire shares details about grants actually made by their DAF, as a representative for Musk has done in the past. Of the $280 million that ", "Forbes ", "estimates Musk has given to charity over his lifetime (without this latest mega-gift), about 20% has been donated through DAFs.", "One of the advantages of giving stock to a DAF is that Musk receives the tax benefit of the gift\u2014a tax deduction of as much as 30% of his 2021 adjusted gross income\u2014as soon as he makes the donation, even though the shares are sitting in the equivalent of a philanthropic holding tank.\u00a0", "A second scenario is that Musk could have pumped the money into his own foundation instead. In that case, he\u2019d still receive an immediate income tax deduction. But, unlike a gift directly to a DAF, foundations are required to disperse about 5% of assets annually. (If the foundation distributes more than 5% in one year, it can carry forward the excess for five years. If the percentage is not met, the foundation simply pays more in taxes).\u00a0\u00a0", "Up until now, at least, Musk has ranked among the less charitable billionaires in the world, especially relative to the size of his fortune. But there is evidence that he may be thinking of stepping things up. In February 2021, he announced ", "a $100 million \u201cXPRIZE\u201d", " to be split among teams that can create scalable mechanisms to remove carbon from the atmosphere. He\u2019s funded just over half of the total prize purse to the ", "X-Prize Foundation", ", which is overseeing the award, so far, according to a representative for Musk. It has already doled out ", "$5 million", " of that sum among 23 student-led teams to support the early stages of their carbon-removal projects, but the full competition won\u2019t wrap up until 2025.\u00a0", "Last year, Musk gave $55 million to St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital. He also donated about $30 million to a variety of public schools and nonprofits based throughout the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas, where SpaceX builds its rockets; the donations were ", "announced", " in March 2021 amid ", "mounting criticism", " from local activists who say the company is harming the region\u2019s ecosystem and pushing out longtime communities.\u00a0", "For the fiscal year ended June 2020, the most recent for which filings are available, ", "the Musk Foundation doled out less than $24 million", " of its total assets of $941 million. Of that, about $20 million landed in a DAF. The remaining $2.9 million primarily went to education-related causes. The Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank at George Mason University in northern Virginia that aims to advance free-market ideas, got $1 million from Musk.\u00a0The Mercatus donation was intended for \u201cCovid-19 scientific research,\u201d according to the Musk Foundation\u2019s tax filing. Another $1 million went to the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit behind Wikipedia. The next biggest donation\u2014$500,000\u2014landed with Hack Club, a nonprofit that oversees a network of nearly 500 student-led coding clubs around the world. Musk gave an additional $1 million to Hack Club this past fall. ", "He\u2019s also given his time to the group. After a few teenage members dug up Musk\u2019s contact information in public records and asked him to speak to the organization in March 2020, Musk agreed and devoted over an hour to a live Q&A video chat the following month\u2014and made his first donation to the organization soon after. \u201cIt allowed us to hugely increase our hiring of engineers to create cool coding games, to one-on-one mentor the teenagers and to support them to build things to code,\u201d says Hack Club\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Christina Asquith.\u00a0", "Musk also donated to a handful of exclusive Los Angeles private schools in 2020, including Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica and The Windward School. His foundation earmarked $50,000 for a Covid-19 antibody study at Sacred Heart University, a private catholic university situated in a Connecticut suburb of New York City.

So far, Musk has\u00a0donated just .001% of his $246 billion fortune\u2014", "Forbes ", "is not counting the $5.7 billion donation until we know that it is actually being put to use by a charity.\u00a0", "Most of his ultra-rich billionaire peers boast better track records. Warren Buffett, far and away the most charitable, has donated about $46.1 billion in his lifetime, or 40% of his $115.6 billion fortune. In 2010, Buffett and Bill Gates cofounded the Giving Pledge\u2014a non-binding oath taken by some of the world\u2019s richest people to donate the majority of their fortunes during their lifetimes or after their deaths. Gates has donated $33.4 billion alongside his ex-wife Melinda French Gates\u2014about 24% of their combined $140.7 billion estimated net worth. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has given out $2.1 billion to charitable causes, including some $1.3 billion toward climate-focused causes\u2014which equates to about 1% of his estimated $188 billion fortune.\u00a0", "Musk ", "signed", " the Giving Pledge in 2012, and the 50-year-old CEO has indicated that he\u2019ll ramp up giving later in life.

Billionaire Marvy Finger thinks a flood of new rental units will hold down future increases, but other developers are more bullish.", "So what did Finger hold on to? He kept some trophies, like One Park Place, a high-end tower he built in downtown Houston adjacent to Discovery Green park, and 500 Crawford, a luxe mid-rise across the street from Minute Maid Park, where the Astros play. And some properties with sentimental value, like Colony Oaks, the very first two-story walkup complex that he built in Houston in 1960; selling that \u201cwould be like selling my first born.\u201d ", "Significantly, Finger also retained properties that he thought had more appreciation left in their underlying dirt. One fully leased 152-unit complex he built in the 1960s is on seven acres adjacent to the private Duchesne School. \u201cThe school now has nowhere to grow but on to that land,\u201d he muses. The land is currently appraised by the county at $30 million, but he thinks it\u2019s worth a lot more, especially in famously un-zoned Houston, \"the only major city that really has no restrictions to entry,\" he says. \"It's certainly allowed me to develop at will.\" And eventually, to redevelop. Which is why he says, \u201cI think what I\u2019m holding on to is worth more than what I\u2019m selling.\u201d ", "Finger grew up in an entrepreneurial family. In the 1940s his father Hyman moved from the piney woods near Beaumont, Texas and started Finger Furniture. Marvy grew up sweeping floors, selling furniture, and watching as Hyman made the mistake of bringing his brothers into his business. \u201cI saw the clashes he had with his family and I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a part of it,\u2019\u2019 says Finger, whose two brothers died years ago. Finger received an early discharge from the Army after a disorder led to most of his stomach being removed. In his early 20s he learned from mentor Ben McGuire how to combine loans from insurance companies with mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration to build two-story, wood-frame, brick veneered apartments with 100% financing. \u201cYou really could fully leverage them, without any equity at all,\u2019\u2019 he marvels.", "After successfully building dozens of middle-class apartments, Finger almost lost his shirt on his first office building project, which became one of the infamous \u201csee-through\u201d towers that languished empty, with unfinished interiors after the 1982 oil bust. He resolved to stick with apartments but decided to venture beyond the edges of Houston\u2019s endless sprawl\u2014going all the way to Chicago, where he met attorney Barry Nekritz. \u201cThe thing that made Chicago interesting to him was that it had the best transportation network in the country. You could get on a train and into the city and live near a food store,\u2019\u2019 says Nekritz. In Schaumburg, Illinois, Finger\u2019s contractors are now putting finishing touches on a new mid-rise complex located nearby an older (but still nice) one he put up 35 years ago. Says Nekritz, \u201cI\u2019m 83, but he won\u2019t let me retire because he won\u2019t retire.\u201d Finger still enjoys tennis, though a fly-fishing accident in Belize claimed one of his eyes a few years ago. ", "Nearly 30 years ago Finger\u2019s projects attracted the attention of the managers of Harvard University\u2019s now $54 billion endowment, who beginning in 1994 teamed up with him to build 16 projects, many of them in south Florida. Chip Douglas, who ran Harvard\u2019s real estate investments back then, recalls Finger\u2019s pursuit of \u201cthe art of building with quality and making the numbers work.\u201d At one building \u201che didn\u2019t like how the pool turned out so he ripped it up and started over.\u201d After a decade, Finger bought out most of Harvard\u2019s interest, but that prestigious relationship opened doors to all the capital he would ever need. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know Finger from Adam, but they sure as hell knew the Harvard seal,\u2019\u2019 Finger says.", "Since then, the builder has signed on other big name equity partners, including Houston billionaire Fayez Sarofim and the children of the late pipeline tycoon Dan Duncan. He has also built bigger, taller projects, such as the Museum Tower in Houston, appraised by Harris County at $100 million. ", "Along with tapping Texas money, Finger has built off his deep Houston connections. In 2006, he heard from his daughter Jill Jewett, then head of cultural affairs for Houston Mayor Bill White, that billionaire Rich Kinder was working with the city to build a city park called Discovery Green that would transform downtown. Forewarned, Finger scooped up a lot and set to work on a 340-unit high rise called One Park Place that would overlook the new park. Eyebrows raised; there hadn\u2019t been a residential tower built downtown in 20 years. He kitted it out with a replica of the pool at the Ritz-Carlton in Maui and lured a high-end grocery store to the ground floor. \u201cThe number one amenity is a food concession,\u201d he says. Still, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, tenants were hard to find, and it took years to fill the units. \u201cI never thought about risk on that project,\u201d he says now. The building is valued at $158 million. As Houston boomed post-Great Recession, he followed up with a string of luxe projects like the eight-story 500 Crawford, across from Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, and now appraised at $91 million. No vacancies. ", "Finger likes to daydream about what might someday replace the 20 acres with 540 garden apartments at the Creole On Yorktown that he built in the early 1970s with financing from Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns. It was the first and last time he ever incorporated an on-premises bar (a security nightmare). He almost lost the complex to bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, \u201cbut nobody wanted to buy a negative cash flowing property.\u201d Eventually, \u201cHouston\u2019s market did turn,\u201d and he\u2019s owned it ever since, with the tony Galleria neighborhood growing up around it. After the next oil bust in the early 1980s and the savings and loans crisis, Finger picked up some gems at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed to liquidate the failed S&Ls. His purchases included a three-acre parcel in the Galleria where he built a modest complex (valued at $10 million). The site, now adjacent to an Omni Hotel and the tony Houstonian Golf Club & Spa, could someday yield to a redevelopment worth many times that. ", "In late 2019 Finger raised $90 million to erect a new luxury tower on another nearby plot. But he called the project off even before Covid-19 hit, concerned that an inverting yield curve signaled economic trouble ahead. With today\u2019s high demand, that building would have filled up fast, but he doesn\u2019t regret pulling back. \u201cThe fundamentals have to make sense.\u201d When they do, Finger (plus heir apparent daughter Jill and son Edward) has the land on which to erect a number of high-rise redevelopments. He\u2019s in no hurry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now can\u2019t last,\u201d he says, referring to the rampant construction of apartment buildings. In Houston, for example, builders currently hold permits to build 42,000 units, more than twice the normal number. Prices for labor and materials are surging. Having seen bubbles before, Finger is content to wait. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get overbuilt again. The glut is definitely coming.\u201d ", "MORE FROM FORBES"]},

It needs to grow near the sea, and it gains this nice salinity there. The Castelprile location is only a few miles from the ocean, and it grows well here. It has the sea in the front and a ridge of hills in the back, with sandy soils in the vineyard. The wines have a perfect mineral undertone that is wonderful.

I\u2019m hoping to make a mold out of it and reproduce it in the near future.\u201d An art historian by training, Weathers notes, \u201cThese pieces are more than just glass. They\u2019re decorative objects with historical and cultural importance. They are symbolic artifacts of a slower time, when craftsmanship was highly considered, and reflective of motifs in art and design that were contemporaneous to the pieces.\u201d Many of the glass elements that animate Pontiel Jewelry came from the multi-generational, family-run glass studios that shut down because of World War II. As Weathers notes, \u201cThe techniques that were used before the War remain obscure and un-replicated. One of my goals is to design and produce my own glass pieces using these traditional techniques.\u201d", "Weathers sets her etched, pierced and molded glass into sterling silver, vermeil and gold jewelry. \u201cMost factories that had been producing glass for use in jewelry and other accessories in the former Czechoslovakia, France and Germany were either converted to produce materials for the war effort or shut down by their owners,\u201d she notes. This time of chaos, along with Europe\u2019s prolonged post-war recovery, put an end to mass production of etched, pierced or molded glass elements for jewelry.", "According to Weathers, her favorite jewelry designers include Lalique, Buccellati, Elsa Peretti and ", "Anabela Chan", ", along with Shaun Leane, Ted Muehling and Lalaounis. As she tells it, \u201cI\u2019ve always been creatively pre-occupied with color, light and transparency. I studied painting and art history at Occidental College in Los Angeles, where my fascination with the transparency of paint evolved into a serious interest in glass as a jewelry material.\u201d", "After graduating from Occidental, Weathers worked in various museums and galleries in Los Angeles and London. \u201cBack in the 1990s,\u201d she relates, \u201cI bought a fabulous pair of Art Deco glass earrings at Merola, a London boutique, and that got me hooked on vintage and antique glass as a jewelry material.\u201d Around the same time that she bought those Art Deco earrings, Weathers began designing luxury hair accessories adorned with glass elements and Swarovski crystals for her brand, Shelley Marks Accessories. \u201cMy pieces sold around the world at Harrod\u2019s in London, various Neiman Marcus stores across the U.S. and also at Barneys in New York and Beverly Hills, CA.,\u201d she recalls. Hair accessories by Weathers were also often featured editorially in U.S. and international editions of ", "Vogue", " and ", "Elle", ". ", "After decades of amassing vintage glass elements from around the world, Weathers formed Pontiel in 2019 as a creative avenue to glorify the glass in her collection. As Philip Jelley, Senior Vice-President and Senior Specialist in ", "Sotheby\u2019s New York", " Valuations Department observes, \u201cCollectors after all are custodians of art and culture for future generations.\u201d Weathers agrees, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a collector who is also a designer who gives new life to these extraordinary vintage or antique glass elements.\u201d Explaining the meaning of her brand\u2019s name, she continues, \u201cA pontiel is an iron rod used in glass-making for rotating the glass while it is soft. Because I am so intrigued by and respectful of glass artisans, I named my jewelry brand Pontiel.\u201d", "Like all connoisseurs, Weathers is a dedicated sleuth who never reveals her sources. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I have a network of suppliers around the world,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve been collecting for decades and at the moment I have over 500 pieces. The whole thing about people in the vintage glass world,\u201d she relates, \u201cis that they are really secretive and protective of their sources. After making a zillion phone calls,\u201d Weathers recollects, \u201cI eventually found a woman that had been collecting vintage glass for 60 years. The magnitude of great things she has in her collection is astounding.\u201d", "Some of the most impressive pieces that Weathers owns and occasionally sets into bespoke or retail jewels include iridescent scarab beetles that radiate vibrant colors that change according to the ambient light. As Weathers explains, \u201cThe word iridescent comes from Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow. Examples of naturally iridescent materials include peacock feathers, opals, blue Morpho butterflies, oil slicks and soap bubbles.\u201d Although Weathers has set some iridescent scarabs into earrings and pendants, she\u2019s guarding some of the scarabs for herself, as she suspects they may have been made around the turn of the 20", "th", " century by the great New York-based jeweler Louis Comfort Tiffany. \u201cThese pieces look remarkably similar to Tiffany\u2019s Favrile iridescent glass,\u201d Weathers notes. \u201cI treasure them.\u201d", "[Writer\u2019s note: Favrile glass is a type of iridescent art glass created by Louis Comfort Tiffany. After patenting this process in 1894, he first produced Favrile for manufacture in 1896 in the \u201cTiffany Furnace\u201d factory in Corona, Queen, across the river from New York City.]", "\u201cThe magic of the vintage and antique glass that I use in my designs lies in the obscure but masterly artisanal techniques involved in making these things,\u201d Weathers ventures. Applied arts experts like Jelley puts the work of Weathers in another light. \u201cWhat Pontiel brings to the table,\u201d he says, \u201cis curating images and materials that have been lost in the firmament and bringing them new relevance.\u201d ", "\u201cGlass is an amazing material, \u201c Weathers says. \u201cSince antiquity, glass has been made to embody every color in the rainbow plus gold, silver and copper, yet glass can allow light to pass through it and create dramatic effects,\u201d Weathers concludes. \u201cThis makes it an ideal material for jewelry of rare beauty. I hope to expand my collection, indefinitely!\u201d"]},

Not If This Billionaire Is Right", "corpus_content_parts": ["Marvy Finger recently sold half his portfolio of Sunbelt apartments for $2 billion, saying the Covid-crazed rental market has peaked. The buyers, pointing to a 20-year low vacancy rate, disagree. ", "For a real estate tycoon, Marvy Finger\u2019s second-floor offices in a low-slung Houston office building are as modest as the first apartment buildings he erected nearly 60 years ago \u2014 and still owns. \u201cI like simplicity and livability,\u201d says the 5-foot-5-inch, slightly stooped 86-year-old, whose unassuming uniform consists of khakis, oxford shirt, penny loafers and an Hermes tie offset by a Timex watch. His go-to drink is Johnnie Walker Black Scotch and he has a similar taste for value in business too.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Finger says, of the 25% increase during the Covid-19 pandemic in apartment rents in key sunbelt cities like Tampa, Austin, Nashville and Houston. He points to rampant new construction nationwide, with so many buildings springing up that 600,000 new units came to market last year \u2014 nearly double the previous record. Meanwhile, those federal stimulus checks that fattened renters\u2019 wallets have been mostly spent and price increases for other necessities, like energy and food, are competing for their remaining dollars.", "\u201cI am absolutely programming for a major correction,\u2019\u2019 says Finger. That\u2019s why this past December he sold half his portfolio \u2014 15,000 units in Houston, Dallas and Atlanta \u2014 to real estate investor Greystar for $2 billion. He thought it was a rich price, equal to about 33 times expected 2022 net operating income (rental income minus expenses) of $60 million. Figuring the package would have fetched some 75% less before Covid-19, Finger concluded, \u201cit would be irresponsible not to sell.\u201d ", "Yet while Finger was a happy seller, Greystar was a happy buyer, says Kevin Kaberna, its investment director, who admires Finger\u2019s vigor and calls him a \u201cprolific developer of the nicest assets in best locations.\u201d With 54,000 units in Houston, Greystar was already the biggest landlord in town and Kaberna insists the market remains fantastic \u2013 he points out the nationwide vacancy rate is down to 5.2%, the lowest in at least 20 years, with outright shortages in the hottest markets. The biggest tailwind trend, says Dallas-based real estate consultant Ron Witten, is the \u201cundoubling\u201d of households as some Millennials (including those who moved home during the early pandemic days) leave their parents\u2019 nests, and others already out on their own jettison annoying roommates.", "How High Can The Rent Go?", "With apartment vacancy rates low and falling, landlords pushed through record rent hikes in 2021. Billionaire Marvy Finger thinks a flood of new rental units will hold down future increases, but other developers are more bullish.", "So what did Finger hold on to? He kept some trophies, like One Park Place, a high-end tower he built in downtown Houston adjacent to Discovery Green park, and 500 Crawford, a luxe mid-rise across the street from Minute Maid Park, where the Astros play. And some properties with sentimental value, like Colony Oaks, the very first two-story walkup complex that he built in Houston in 1960; selling that \u201cwould be like selling my first born.\u201d ", "Significantly, Finger also retained properties that he thought had more appreciation left in their underlying dirt. One fully leased 152-unit complex he built in the 1960s is on seven acres adjacent to the private Duchesne School. \u201cThe school now has nowhere to grow but on to that land,\u201d he muses. The land is currently appraised by the county at $30 million, but he thinks it\u2019s worth a lot more, especially in famously un-zoned Houston, \"the only major city that really has no restrictions to entry,\" he says. \"It's certainly allowed me to develop at will.\" And eventually, to redevelop. Which is why he says, \u201cI think what I\u2019m holding on to is worth more than what I\u2019m selling.\u201d ", "Finger grew up in an entrepreneurial family. In the 1940s his father Hyman moved from the piney woods near Beaumont, Texas and started Finger Furniture. Marvy grew up sweeping floors, selling furniture, and watching as Hyman made the mistake of bringing his brothers into his business. \u201cI saw the clashes he had with his family and I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a part of it,\u2019\u2019 says Finger, whose two brothers died years ago. Finger received an early discharge from the Army after a disorder led to most of his stomach being removed. In his early 20s he learned from mentor Ben McGuire how to combine loans from insurance companies with mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration to build two-story, wood-frame, brick veneered apartments with 100% financing. \u201cYou really could fully leverage them, without any equity at all,\u2019\u2019 he marvels.", "After successfully building dozens of middle-class apartments, Finger almost lost his shirt on his first office building project, which became one of the infamous \u201csee-through\u201d towers that languished empty, with unfinished interiors after the 1982 oil bust. He resolved to stick with apartments but decided to venture beyond the edges of Houston\u2019s endless sprawl\u2014going all the way to Chicago, where he met attorney Barry Nekritz. \u201cThe thing that made Chicago interesting to him was that it had the best transportation network in the country. You could get on a train and into the city and live near a food store,\u2019\u2019 says Nekritz. In Schaumburg, Illinois, Finger\u2019s contractors are now putting finishing touches on a new mid-rise complex located nearby an older (but still nice) one he put up 35 years ago. Says Nekritz, \u201cI\u2019m 83, but he won\u2019t let me retire because he won\u2019t retire.\u201d Finger still enjoys tennis, though a fly-fishing accident in Belize claimed one of his eyes a few years ago. ", "Nearly 30 years ago Finger\u2019s projects attracted the attention of the managers of Harvard University\u2019s now $54 billion endowment, who beginning in 1994 teamed up with him to build 16 projects, many of them in south Florida. Chip Douglas, who ran Harvard\u2019s real estate investments back then, recalls Finger\u2019s pursuit of \u201cthe art of building with quality and making the numbers work.\u201d At one building \u201che didn\u2019t like how the pool turned out so he ripped it up and started over.\u201d After a decade, Finger bought out most of Harvard\u2019s interest, but that prestigious relationship opened doors to all the capital he would ever need. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know Finger from Adam, but they sure as hell knew the Harvard seal,\u2019\u2019 Finger says.", "Since then, the builder has signed on other big name equity partners, including Houston billionaire Fayez Sarofim and the children of the late pipeline tycoon Dan Duncan. He has also built bigger, taller projects, such as the Museum Tower in Houston, appraised by Harris County at $100 million. ", "Along with tapping Texas money, Finger has built off his deep Houston connections. In 2006, he heard from his daughter Jill Jewett, then head of cultural affairs for Houston Mayor Bill White, that billionaire Rich Kinder was working with the city to build a city park called Discovery Green that would transform downtown. Forewarned, Finger scooped up a lot and set to work on a 340-unit high rise called One Park Place that would overlook the new park. Eyebrows raised; there hadn\u2019t been a residential tower built downtown in 20 years. He kitted it out with a replica of the pool at the Ritz-Carlton in Maui and lured a high-end grocery store to the ground floor. \u201cThe number one amenity is a food concession,\u201d he says. Still, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, tenants were hard to find, and it took years to fill the units. \u201cI never thought about risk on that project,\u201d he says now. The building is valued at $158 million. As Houston boomed post-Great Recession, he followed up with a string of luxe projects like the eight-story 500 Crawford, across from Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, and now appraised at $91 million. No vacancies. ", "Finger likes to daydream about what might someday replace the 20 acres with 540 garden apartments at the Creole On Yorktown that he built in the early 1970s with financing from Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns. It was the first and last time he ever incorporated an on-premises bar (a security nightmare). He almost lost the complex to bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, \u201cbut nobody wanted to buy a negative cash flowing property.\u201d Eventually, \u201cHouston\u2019s market did turn,\u201d and he\u2019s owned it ever since, with the tony Galleria neighborhood growing up around it. After the next oil bust in the early 1980s and the savings and loans crisis, Finger picked up some gems at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed to liquidate the failed S&Ls. His purchases included a three-acre parcel in the Galleria where he built a modest complex (valued at $10 million). The site, now adjacent to an Omni Hotel and the tony Houstonian Golf Club & Spa, could someday yield to a redevelopment worth many times that. ", "In late 2019 Finger raised $90 million to erect a new luxury tower on another nearby plot. But he called the project off even before Covid-19 hit, concerned that an inverting yield curve signaled economic trouble ahead. With today\u2019s high demand, that building would have filled up fast, but he doesn\u2019t regret pulling back. \u201cThe fundamentals have to make sense.\u201d When they do, Finger (plus heir apparent daughter Jill and son Edward) has the land on which to erect a number of high-rise redevelopments. He\u2019s in no hurry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now can\u2019t last,\u201d he says, referring to the rampant construction of apartment buildings. In Houston, for example, builders currently hold permits to build 42,000 units, more than twice the normal number. Prices for labor and materials are surging. Having seen bubbles before, Finger is content to wait. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get overbuilt again. The glut is definitely coming.\u201d ", "MORE FROM FORBES"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/", "author_name": null, "author_contrib_type": null, "author_subcontext_header": null, "author_about": "", "author_social_links": []}},

Szechuan cuisine is also separated into four different cuisine styles: Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong and Buddhist vegetarian style. ", "At Z & Y Restaurant, we focus on the first two: Chongqing and Chengdu. Chongqing style is the well-known bold flavors with liberal use of the chili peppers and oil. Chengdu style has a more subtle taste with less chili peppers. We feature both styles on the menu to welcome guests that enjoy spice-centric food as well as guests that prefer mild flavors, but want to experience Sichuan cuisine.", "How does Z & Y Restaurant stand out from other restaurants in Chinatown?

After moving to the Bay Area, I learned that there were not many authentic Szechuan restaurants, so I opened Z & Y Restaurant in 2008. While serving at the Consulate General of the People\u2019s Republic of China in San Francisco, I wanted to bring in Szechuan culture and introduce it to the United States. ", "However, I never had the chance to until Z & Y Restaurant. In 2017, I introduced two Szechuan performances to our guests: Gong Fu Cha (Kung Fu Tea) and Bian Lian (Face Change).

Follow us on our social media so you know when these performances begin!", "Why did you choose Szechuan cuisine? What about it, compared to other Chinese cuisines styles, drew you to it?", "When I was still studying in Beijing, China, I was appointed to be trained as a Szechuan chef. After three years of training, I had fallen in love with the variety of Szechuan dishes and the different flavors that it brings to the palate. This cuisine can go from pungent and hot to fresh and aromatic and serves guests who enjoy extremely spicy food but also guests who love the freshness of Chinese cuisine. It is the perfect cuisine for everyone!", "You have cooked for many Chinese presidents in the past. What was that like and what did you serve them?", "During my time in China, I served two presidents: Deng Xiaoping and Hu Jintao. They both love Szechuan cuisine! Deng Xiaoping\u2019s favorite was Tan Tan Noodles, which is one of our popular dishes at the restaurant. Hu Jintao, on the other hand, enjoyed a more subtle flavor. His favorite was Wensi Tofu Thread Soup. This is a luxurious soup featuring hand-sliced tofu simmered in chicken stock.", "Talk about Kung Fu Tea. Where did it originate? Is it a common thing to see in the States? How unique is it to your restaurant?", "Instead of being a type of tea, Kung Fu Tea is a way of brewing the tea. It is both unique and entertaining for spectators. These Kung Fu Tea masters have been studying the art of the tea ceremony for many years in China, so there are only very few masters in the United States.", "As to the origin, there are many speculations about how this ritual began. One of my favorite speculations is the teapot with the long spout was created when the Chinese would visit tea houses to discuss politics and businesses. Instead of walking next to the table, the servers would pour the tea through the long teapot spout, so they would not hear any confidential conversations at the table."], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/chelseadavis/", "author_name": null, "author_contrib_type": null, "author_subcontext_header": null, "author_about": "", "author_social_links": []}},

(Weathers can create 18-karat or higher gold pieces for bespoke clients.) Pontiel jewels include antique iridescent Egyptian Revival scarab beetle pendants, aquamarine glass plaques of Art Deco-era female silhouettes; gracefully etched sunrays, flowers and other enchanting life forms.

Consequently, there\u2019s an intriguing historical aura, texture and presence of the past embodied in these adornments. As Weathers explains, \u201cI\u2019m passionate about the intricacies and motifs in each piece of etched, molded or pierced glass that I find. The unique characteristics, tones and colors of each piece are what make them intriguing, rare and collectible.\u201d", "For example, pierced, etched and molded glass plaque designs were mass manufactured in the years preceding World War II in diverse colors and sculptural shapes, such as pyramids, lozenges, octagons, squares or circles. These variously embodied such highly detailed motifs as female figures, long-legged wading birds, floral bouquets, luscious fruits, abstract Cubist designs or radiant sunrays. Weathers also collects and uses camphor glass in some of her jewelry designs. Frosted-looking, semi-opaque and similar in appearance to carved rock crystal, camphor glass pieces were made during the Art Deco era (circa 1908 -1935). Its distinctive misty effect was created by treating clear colorless, blue or pink glass with vaporized hydrofluoric acid.", "All Pontiel pieces are handmade in Houston by three master artisans.

I\u2019m hoping to make a mold out of it and reproduce it in the near future.\u201d An art historian by training, Weathers notes, \u201cThese pieces are more than just glass. They\u2019re decorative objects with historical and cultural importance. They are symbolic artifacts of a slower time, when craftsmanship was highly considered, and reflective of motifs in art and design that were contemporaneous to the pieces.\u201d Many of the glass elements that animate Pontiel Jewelry came from the multi-generational, family-run glass studios that shut down because of World War II. As Weathers notes, \u201cThe techniques that were used before the War remain obscure and un-replicated. One of my goals is to design and produce my own glass pieces using these traditional techniques.\u201d", "Weathers sets her etched, pierced and molded glass into sterling silver, vermeil and gold jewelry. \u201cMost factories that had been producing glass for use in jewelry and other accessories in the former Czechoslovakia, France and Germany were either converted to produce materials for the war effort or shut down by their owners,\u201d she notes. This time of chaos, along with Europe\u2019s prolonged post-war recovery, put an end to mass production of etched, pierced or molded glass elements for jewelry.", "According to Weathers, her favorite jewelry designers include Lalique, Buccellati, Elsa Peretti and ", "Anabela Chan", ", along with Shaun Leane, Ted Muehling and Lalaounis. As she tells it, \u201cI\u2019ve always been creatively pre-occupied with color, light and transparency. I studied painting and art history at Occidental College in Los Angeles, where my fascination with the transparency of paint evolved into a serious interest in glass as a jewelry material.\u201d", "After graduating from Occidental, Weathers worked in various museums and galleries in Los Angeles and London. \u201cBack in the 1990s,\u201d she relates, \u201cI bought a fabulous pair of Art Deco glass earrings at Merola, a London boutique, and that got me hooked on vintage and antique glass as a jewelry material.\u201d Around the same time that she bought those Art Deco earrings, Weathers began designing luxury hair accessories adorned with glass elements and Swarovski crystals for her brand, Shelley Marks Accessories. \u201cMy pieces sold around the world at Harrod\u2019s in London, various Neiman Marcus stores across the U.S. and also at Barneys in New York and Beverly Hills, CA.,\u201d she recalls.

As Philip Jelley, Senior Vice-President and Senior Specialist in ", "Sotheby\u2019s New York", " Valuations Department observes, \u201cCollectors after all are custodians of art and culture for future generations.\u201d Weathers agrees, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a collector who is also a designer who gives new life to these extraordinary vintage or antique glass elements.\u201d Explaining the meaning of her brand\u2019s name, she continues, \u201cA pontiel is an iron rod used in glass-making for rotating the glass while it is soft. Because I am so intrigued by and respectful of glass artisans, I named my jewelry brand Pontiel.\u201d", "Like all connoisseurs, Weathers is a dedicated sleuth who never reveals her sources. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I have a network of suppliers around the world,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve been collecting for decades and at the moment I have over 500 pieces. The whole thing about people in the vintage glass world,\u201d she relates, \u201cis that they are really secretive and protective of their sources. After making a zillion phone calls,\u201d Weathers recollects, \u201cI eventually found a woman that had been collecting vintage glass for 60 years. The magnitude of great things she has in her collection is astounding.\u201d", "Some of the most impressive pieces that Weathers owns and occasionally sets into bespoke or retail jewels include iridescent scarab beetles that radiate vibrant colors that change according to the ambient light. As Weathers explains, \u201cThe word iridescent comes from Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow. Examples of naturally iridescent materials include peacock feathers, opals, blue Morpho butterflies, oil slicks and soap bubbles.\u201d Although Weathers has set some iridescent scarabs into earrings and pendants, she\u2019s guarding some of the scarabs for herself, as she suspects they may have been made around the turn of the 20", "th", " century by the great New York-based jeweler Louis Comfort Tiffany. \u201cThese pieces look remarkably similar to Tiffany\u2019s Favrile iridescent glass,\u201d Weathers notes. \u201cI treasure them.\u201d", "[Writer\u2019s note: Favrile glass is a type of iridescent art glass created by Louis Comfort Tiffany. After patenting this process in 1894, he first produced Favrile for manufacture in 1896 in the \u201cTiffany Furnace\u201d factory in Corona, Queen, across the river from New York City.]", "\u201cThe magic of the vintage and antique glass that I use in my designs lies in the obscure but masterly artisanal techniques involved in making these things,\u201d Weathers ventures. Applied arts experts like Jelley puts the work of Weathers in another light. \u201cWhat Pontiel brings to the table,\u201d he says, \u201cis curating images and materials that have been lost in the firmament and bringing them new relevance.\u201d ", "\u201cGlass is an amazing material, \u201c Weathers says. \u201cSince antiquity, glass has been made to embody every color in the rainbow plus gold, silver and copper, yet glass can allow light to pass through it and create dramatic effects,\u201d Weathers concludes. \u201cThis makes it an ideal material for jewelry of rare beauty.

This particular wine, a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot, is sourced from an estate vineyard with rocky soils that overlooks much of the southern reaches of the valley; produced for more than 20 vintages, this is considered by numerous insiders as one of the \u201cGrand Cru\u201d sites in the region. Inky purple, with aromas of bitter chocolate, blackberry and clove, this is a ripe, powerful Cabernet Sauvignon with rich tannins that are quite supple; the power you sense in the mouth is mitigated by these round tannins. The finish, with its notes of graphite, ash and black cherry, is highly distinctive and offers an outstanding sense of place. While this could be enjoyed tonight with a T-bone steak, this will be a much more glorious drinking experience over the years, with peak drinking in 15-20 years, or perhaps even longer (96)", "Stags\u2019 Leap Winery Cabernet Sauvignon \u201cThe Leap\u201d 2018 ", "(Stags Leap District, Napa Valley) - Medium deep purple; aromas of black plum, black raspberry and clove. Medium-full with excellent concentration. There is good acidity, notable persistence and excellent depth of fruit, as well as round, medium-full tannins. However, the wood notes are rather strong, giving the wine a slightly unbalanced feel. Other than that, this is a very impressive wine that needs time to round out a bit, with peak in 12-15 years. (91)", "Beaulieu Vineyard Tapestry 2018 ", "- While this wine is labeled as a Napa Valley Red Wine, it is technically a Cabernet Sauvignon, as it contains 78% of that varietal (the minimum percentage to be varietally labeled in California is 75%); the remaining 22% is a blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Deep purple; aromas of baking chocolate, black cherry and hints of anise and raspberry. Medium-full with ideal ripeness, medium-full tannins that are velvety and perfectly balanced, very good acidity and a fruit-driven finish of medium-length. While this is not as full on the palate as the winery\u2019s various offerings of Cabernet Sauvignon, it is quite harmonious and can be enjoyed at a much earlier stage. Pair with most red meats now and over the next few years, or put away for five to seven years, with peak in 10 years. This is a fine value at a suggested retail price of $65.

Medium-full with a rich mid-palate offering beautifully ripe black currant and black cherry fruit, backed by very good acidity, medium-full tannins that are well-rounded.

This should drink well for another 12-15 years, and could peak a few years after that. (95)", "Clos du Val Cabernet Sauvignon \u201cHirondelle Vineyard\u201d 2018 ", "(Stags Leap District, Napa Valley) - Clos du Val has been producing Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon since 1972. While the style of the wines has changed slightly over the past decade, the wines continue to offer the silky tannins and bright fruit so typical of the Stags Leap District.", "The Hirondelle Vineyard, acquired by the winery in 1972, has become one of the most important sources of Cabernet Sauvignon at Clos du Val. The vineyard performed brilliantly in 2018, as noted by owner Olav Goelet; \u201cmild daytime temperatures and cool evenings at our Stags Leap District estate allowed for slow and controlled ripening, enabling us to create wines with remarkable freshness, acidity, and tannin structure.\u201d ", "100% Cabernet Sauvignon.

We haven\u2019t had enough examples for girls to consider becoming a producer or DJ, and much of society has been conditioned to assume it as an occupation for men.

This particular wine, a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot, is sourced from an estate vineyard with rocky soils that overlooks much of the southern reaches of the valley; produced for more than 20 vintages, this is considered by numerous insiders as one of the \u201cGrand Cru\u201d sites in the region. Inky purple, with aromas of bitter chocolate, blackberry and clove, this is a ripe, powerful Cabernet Sauvignon with rich tannins that are quite supple; the power you sense in the mouth is mitigated by these round tannins. The finish, with its notes of graphite, ash and black cherry, is highly distinctive and offers an outstanding sense of place. While this could be enjoyed tonight with a T-bone steak, this will be a much more glorious drinking experience over the years, with peak drinking in 15-20 years, or perhaps even longer (96)", "Stags\u2019 Leap Winery Cabernet Sauvignon \u201cThe Leap\u201d 2018 ", "(Stags Leap District, Napa Valley) - Medium deep purple; aromas of black plum, black raspberry and clove. Medium-full with excellent concentration. There is good acidity, notable persistence and excellent depth of fruit, as well as round, medium-full tannins. However, the wood notes are rather strong, giving the wine a slightly unbalanced feel. Other than that, this is a very impressive wine that needs time to round out a bit, with peak in 12-15 years. (91)", "Beaulieu Vineyard Tapestry 2018 ", "- While this wine is labeled as a Napa Valley Red Wine, it is technically a Cabernet Sauvignon, as it contains 78% of that varietal (the minimum percentage to be varietally labeled in California is 75%); the remaining 22% is a blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Deep purple; aromas of baking chocolate, black cherry and hints of anise and raspberry. Medium-full with ideal ripeness, medium-full tannins that are velvety and perfectly balanced, very good acidity and a fruit-driven finish of medium-length. While this is not as full on the palate as the winery\u2019s various offerings of Cabernet Sauvignon, it is quite harmonious and can be enjoyed at a much earlier stage. Pair with most red meats now and over the next few years, or put away for five to seven years, with peak in 10 years. This is a fine value at a suggested retail price of $65. (92)", "Spottswoode Estate Cabernet Sauvignon 2018 ", "(St. Helena, Napa Valley) - I\u2019ve been a fan of this wine ever since the initial release from the 1982 vintage.

Deep, intense purple; aromas of black currant, black plum and violets. Full-bodied with excellent concentration, this offers a rich, layered mid-palate, excellent persistence, well-integrated oak, medium-full, nicely rounded tannins, very good acidity and superb typicity. Notable complexity, this is ultra-impressive now and should drink well for at least two decades, with peak in 20-25 years. (96)", "Silverado Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon \u201cSolo\u201d 2018 ", "(Stags Leap District, Napa Valley) - Founded in 1981 on the west side of the Silverado Trail, this estate has been among the most consistent of all Cabernet Sauvignon producers in Napa Valley, yet rarely gets the attention of many of its neighbors. ", "Bright, deep ruby red; aromas of black plum, black raspberry and a hint of cocoa powder. Medium-full with a rich mid-palate offering beautifully ripe black currant and black cherry fruit, backed by very good acidity, medium-full tannins that are well-rounded. The wood notes are beautifully integrated and there is excellent persistence. Beautiful overall harmony, classic varietal purity and typicity and a wine of excellent structure. This should drink well for another 12-15 years, and could peak a few years after that. (95)", "Clos du Val Cabernet Sauvignon \u201cHirondelle Vineyard\u201d 2018 ", "(Stags Leap District, Napa Valley) - Clos du Val has been producing Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon since 1972. While the style of the wines has changed slightly over the past decade, the wines continue to offer the silky tannins and bright fruit so typical of the Stags Leap District.", "The Hirondelle Vineyard, acquired by the winery in 1972, has become one of the most important sources of Cabernet Sauvignon at Clos du Val. The vineyard performed brilliantly in 2018, as noted by owner Olav Goelet; \u201cmild daytime temperatures and cool evenings at our Stags Leap District estate allowed for slow and controlled ripening, enabling us to create wines with remarkable freshness, acidity, and tannin structure.\u201d ", "100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Bright purple; aromas of black plum, black currant and dark chocolate with a hint of anise. Medium-full with a rich, layered mid-palate. Very good acidity, excellent complexity and ripeness, notable persistence and well-integrated wood notes.

It\u2019s less common to dive into these genres compared to house or dubstep. When my first EP came out, Krewella was the first female act to publicly support and rinse out my music live in their sets. For them to be the first, and somewhat only, females to show me that love is something I\u2019ll never forget\u2014especially because they\u2019ve been one of the OG\u2019s who\u2019ve paved the way for women in bass music and I\u2019ve always been a fan.

It wasn't until more recently in the last couple years that I have actually started to meet amazing women that have literally faced the exact same things that I faced. Alison Wonderland is a really great friend to me. Whatever the situation is, it's really nice to know I'm not alone in it. The same things that happened to me happened to her, and she's a really great role model and friend to me. I think in general, even the women on the up-and-coming, there's so many more women making music right now than there were 10 years ago\u2014I'm talking like electronic production wise.

We haven\u2019t had enough examples for girls to consider becoming a producer or DJ, and much of society has been conditioned to assume it as an occupation for men.

If so, what might this mean for an industry that has struggled with equity, diversity, and inclusion since its racist beginnings? ", "Film sector findings from today\u2019s report reinforce those from the previous one: following the significant advances noted for people of color and women in 2020, both groups made small gains, or at least held their ground, relative to their white and male counterparts in 2021. As a result, both groups enjoyed proportionate representation among film leads and top film roles for the second year in a row. ", "The previous report noted that many of the more diverse films considered for 2020 may not have made the cut as top 200 films (ranked by global box office) if the analysis had been restricted, as in previous reports, to films originally released in theaters. Given the continuing dominance of streaming platforms in 2021, the same is true for the films considered in today\u2019s report. J", "ust as the previous report questioned whether the spikes in on-screen diversity documented for films released in 2020 were just an artifact of the pandemic, so too must we question the stability of the diversity apex today\u2019s report documents for 2021. We are still too close to the pandemic to answer this question definitively, but the findings from today\u2019s report, combined with other film sector trends, suggest that it\u2019s unlikely the post-pandemic normal will look like the one that immediately preceded it.", "But the more things change, as they say, the more they stay the same. The magnitude of the gains made in front of the camera in recent years is far greater than the small incremental gains made behind it. Furthermore, the disparity in film production budgets reveals the persistent inequity in a system that makes it difficult for women and people of color to break through. Replicating findings for 2020 in the previous report, top films directed by people of color and women in 2021 were more likely than those with white male directors to have the smallest budgets. ", "Streaming is Here to Stay", "Despite the allure of the theater experience \u2014 the ", "communal aspects", " and the ", "\u201cparticularity\u201d", " of actually going out to watch a film \u2014 the film sector has reordered itself in recent years.

", "Film release strategies will continue to evolve, but the industry seems to be coalescing around ", "a 45-day theatrical window", ", and simultaneous releases seem likely to stay around. Indeed, ", "studies show", " that 49 percent of pre-pandemic moviegoers are no longer going to theaters, and 8 percent of this missing group may be lost forever. Today\u2019s multiplicity of film release modalities (documented in today\u2019s report for 2021) has thus led to changes in the way companies measure, ", "\u201cor at least spin,\u201d", " how successful a film is.", "Findings from today\u2019s report document that increasingly diverse audiences continued to flex their muscles at the box office and on streaming platforms in 2021, driving domestic ticket sales for the top 10 theatrical releases and accounting for a disproportionate share of the audiences for the top 10 streaming releases. Findings also show that diverse audiences, now market anchors in the film sector, clearly preferred diverse content. That is, the lion\u2019s share of the most highly rated films among diverse households in 2021 (and increasingly among White households and viewers 18-49) featured casts that were ", "at least", " 30 percent minority. ", "Following our conclusion in the previous report, Hollywood would benefit greatly from embracing 2021\u2019s (re)affirmation of the bottom-line possibilities associated with major advances on the diversity front \u2014particularly in a sector reordered by the ascendence of streaming platforms. ", "People of color constituted nearly 43 percent of the U.S. population in 2021, and their share is increasing by about half a percent a year. This trend, combined with diverse audiences\u2019 heavy engagement with original, streaming film content, underscores the importance of diversity as a first-order business imperative for the film industry. The lack of investment in filmmakers who are women and people of color, as noted earlier, must change in order to meet the demand of this diverse audience.", "Hollywood has come a long way since the days of ", "Birth of a Nation", ", but still has much work to do."]},

How did you decide to focus on kimonos? ", "\u201cIt's hard to define when exactly KIM+ONO began because it's really evolved for us from childhood. As children, my sister and co-founder Renee and I were mesmerized by kimonos. Our parents worked with manufacturers in Asia, so we would travel with them and tour artisan villages and see the production process firsthand. We were specifically moved by the artistic process \u2014 the artisans and the handcrafted nature of these traditional pieces. ", "Fast forward to a handful of years ago, and I was working on another creative project that was somewhat stalling out. This was at the same time Renee was running Old Shanghai Online. We started discussing the vision of a potential rebrand for Old Shanghai and bringing the kimono that we so loved from childhood to the forefront of the brand. Our parents had been selling these kinds of pieces in their own shops, but we wanted to bring a modern aesthetic to time-honored traditions, and create our own contemporary designs.\u201d", "How did you decide to open your showroom in Chinatown? ", "\u201cAt the time that Renee and I were discussing our visions for the rebrand, I had also been working in Chinatown at our parents' shop Canton Bazaar, and serendipitously, a family friend presented us with an opportunity. A different space down the block from my parents was becoming available, and our family friend thought we might be interested. Since our parents' shops have been in Chinatown our whole lives, Chinatown has always been a second home to us. With the idea of the rebrand and the opportunity for a storefront in our own community, it all seemed like perfect timing.

To be able to grow up and bring something new to the community that has supported us our whole lives has been a dream come true.

Did retailers band together in any organized way? Did the merchants Association provide support?", "\u201cThe beginning of the pandemic was really tough for us. Our brick and mortar store was forced to close down due to restrictions. I was so grateful for the fact that we also have an online business, as it was able to help keep us afloat during that really uncertain time. Once we were able to reopen our store, the foot traffic was understandably diminished and there weren't as many folks wandering in as there had been before. ", "The Chinatown Merchants Association was a huge help in driving traffic back to our neighborhood through their Walkway Weekends program. They closed down a few blocks on Grant Avenue, where our shop is located, and held different festivities and performances to invite the community back. That made such a big difference for us and we were so grateful for it!\u201d", "How has Chinatown changed since you opened your shop?", "\u201cChinatown has always been an incredible place full of tradition. Since we've been here, Chinatown has certainly preserved that tradition, while also seeing an influx of younger generations of AAPI entrepreneurs and small businesses bringing a freshness and vitality to it.

That listing has been a disaster for investors so far, losing more than 70% of its value since.", "Beyond tech, companies that cater to consumers with rising disposable income will also appeal to Western stock investors, he believes. \u201cWhen somebody that's making $4,000 a year doubles their income, 100 % of that goes back into the economy.\u201d Indonesia, based on its large population of more than 275 million, is \u201cby far and away number one, putting aside Singapore\u201d in growth potential for MBP, he believes, followed by the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.", "What\u2019s ahead for China\u2019s overseas listings?

Those include thresholds for government review by China and for accounting disclosure requirements by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cIn a way, the markets are going to compel people to lay down clear rules,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cOne thing I'm sure about China is they've always been super clear on what they want to do and incredibly hazy on the details of how it gets done. And this is no different.\u201d", "Eventually, however, the U.S. and China sides will come together to agreed accounting rules to facilitate listings, he predicts. \u201cI describe China and the U.S. as in 50-year marriage, which that's exactly what it's been.

This is no criminal extradition, but a welcoming committee, including a caravan of limousines and Mercedes-Benzes, each with two armed bodyguards. The entourage speeds along Ukraine's pockmarked highways, through traffic lights, past lonely farms and dusty roads to the village of Zhitomir.", "Leviev is a local hero. He restored this town's only remaining synagogue, which the Nazis had turned into an arms depot and communists converted to a cinema. Now a ragtag klezmer band serenades him as photographers snap pictures and boys perform a traditional Hasidic dance in his honor. Across some 400 villages in Russia and the former Soviet republics this scene has been replayed countless times. Leviev is a 47-year-old, Uzbeki-born Israeli citizen and devout Lubavitcher who gives away at least $30 million a year in order to return lost Jews to the flock.", "This little-known billionaire is also the scourge of De Beers, the giant miner and marketer of diamonds, known as the \"Syndicate.\" Leviev was once a sightholder, one of a few exclusive direct buyers of De Beers rough diamonds. Today he is the world's largest cutter and polisher of the precious gems and a primary source of rough stones to other cutters, polishers and jewelry makers around the globe. Those who have watched his rise over the last three decades say it was his intense hatred of De Beers that fueled him. He bristled under the Syndicate's high-handed treatment of buyers, who were given boxes of rough diamonds at take-it-or-leave-it prices and risked being permanently cut off if they balked.", "Leviev won't openly criticize his former South African business partner. But his defiance seems thinly disguised. \"I'm not going to let anyone else tell me how to run my business,\" he says. \"I grew up in the Soviet Union. I knew what it was to be afraid. I can remember being beaten regularly by the bullies at school, and I said to myself I would never be afraid of anybody or anything again.\"", "Indeed, he has taken significant business away from De Beers in Russia and Angola\u2014two of the world's largest producers of rough diamonds in terms of value. Leviev has not humbled the once-mighty Syndicate alone. But his defiance has inspired others, like Rio Tinto, owner of Australia's Argyle mine, which bypassed De Beers for the first time in 1996 to sell its 42 million carats directly to polishers in Antwerp. In the early 1990s the Russian government began selling some of its rough supply to others, despite its longtime exclusive deal with De Beers. When miners discovered massive diamond reserves in Canada's Northwest Territories, De Beers had to scramble for a piece. Its share of the rough-diamond market, 80% five years ago, has been cut to 60%.", "The reason Leviev is such a threat is that he has profoundly shaken the tradition-bound diamond business. Until recently De Beers had a virtual chokehold on world supplies, determining who could buy uncut stones\u2014and at what quantities and quality\u2014and where the cutting centers were allowed to prosper. Leviev pulled an end run around the cartel, dealing directly with diamond-producing governments and shattering De Beers' all-important relationship with sightholders. He also became the industry's first diamond dealer with his finger on every facet of production, from mining and cutting to polishing and retailing, capturing profits at every stage.", "Trumping De Beers, Leviev has become very rich. He owns 100% of his diamond business, Lev Leviev Group, and a controlling stake in Africa Israel Investments. The latter is a Yehud, Israel-based conglomerate whose holdings include: commercial real estate in Prague and London; Gottex, a swimwear company; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S.; 173 7-Elevens in New Mexico and Texas; a 33% stake in Cross Israel Highway, that nation's first toll road; and an 85% share of Vash Telecanal, Israel's Russian-language TV channel. Leviev also owns a gold mine in Kazakhstan, pieces of two diamond mines in Angola and mining licenses in the Urals and Namibia. He's probably worth $2 billion.", "A part of that wealth comes from exploiting political connections\u2014which has created enmity and suspicion. A recent example: When Leviev was preparing a bid for 40% of Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the banks supporting him pulled out at the last moment. Sources say it was a lack of transparency in Leviev's business. Even if his hands are clean, Leviev has dealt with people whose mitts are dirty. His ubiquitous brigade of burly armed guards isn't just for show.", "Some of Russia's Jewish establishment resent Leviev's pushing his own brand of Hasidism. He has drawn fire for seeing to it that a Lubavitch rabbi, born in Italy and educated in America, was granted citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Leviev installed him as the country's chief rabbi, though the nation already had one. He's playing with fire, critics say, by aligning himself so closely with Putin. Should the president turn on him, Leviev's Jewish activities could be seen as violating the promise Russia's oligarchs made to Putin to stay out of politics in order to keep their assets\u2014many of which were notoriously acquired in the early 1990s.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. Leviev has also become something of a go-to guy between Israel and central Asian countries, enlisting the secular regimes in those mainly Islamic states in the fight against fundamentalist terror groups. Leviev, who now lives in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Israel, is a close associate of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the presidents of Kazakhstan and his native Uzbekistan. Among his pals in Africa are presidents Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia.", "Leviev grew up in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Though under communism his family was committed to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, and all the males, Leviev included, learned to perform ritual circumcisions in secret. Leviev's father Avner was a successful textile merchant and a collector of rare Persian carpets. After seven years of waiting, the family emigrated to Israel in 1971, having converted their wealth into $1 million in rough diamonds, which they smuggled out of the country. But when they tried to unload them in Israel, they were told the diamonds were of inferior quality, worth only $200,000. Leviev, 15 at the time, vowed to right the wrong. Over his father's objections, he left yeshiva and a life of religious education to take up diamond-cutting.", "He opened his own cutting factory in 1977\u2014when speculation in the burgeoning Israeli diamond market went unchecked. Most cutters held inventory, betting on ever-rising prices. When the market collapsed three years later, banks stopped extending credit and many cutters went bust. Leviev hadn't borrowed against his inventory and was in good enough shape to expand to 12 small factories over the next five years. Scrambling to find enough rough diamonds, he flew frequently to London, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Siberia. He also adapted laser technology and acquired cutting software\u2014a revolutionary innovation at the time\u2014to capture more value from his precious supply. Later his cutters could produce digital 3-D models of various diamond cuts, taking into account imperfections, size, weight and shape before touching the stone. \"Part of his genius,\" says Charles Wyndham, cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants and a former director of De Beers' selling arm, \"was marrying cutting-edge technology to exactly what the market wanted.\"", "In 1987 De Beers invited Leviev to become a sightholder, a plum position granted to fewer than 150 people. By then he was one of Israel's largest manufacturers of polished stones. Two years later Russia's state-run diamond mining and selling group, now called Alrosa, asked Leviev to help it set up its own cutting factories\u2014the first time any rough diamonds were finished in the country of their origin\u2014in a joint venture called Ruis. (For decades De Beers has been channeling all rough diamonds through its Diamond Trading Co. in London before reselling them to sightholders at a markup; a diamond mined in, say, Africa traveled halfway around the world before it was resold to a sightholder in Africa.) Today, Leviev owns 100% of Ruis, which cuts $140 million worth of diamonds a year, and polishing operations, including one in Perm, Russia, another in Armenia.", "Leviev horned in on the business by cultivating a cozy relationship with Valery Rudakov, who under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran Alrosa. The partnership opened the Kremlin door for Leviev. \"I never spoke about business with Gorbachev,\" Leviev insists. \"I talked to him about opening Jewish schools where there had been none for 70 years.\" But he probably confirmed Rudakov's suspicions (and those of Gorby) that De Beers was lowballing the country on the value of its gems.", "Leviev's deal gave him a piece of Russia's rough-diamond supply, and gave De Beers fits. By 1995 it had had enough of this upstart and booted him from the sightholders' circle. It is widely believed that Leviev, perhaps anticipating the Syndicate's retaliation, had already secured rough supply from Gokhran, Russia's repository of gems, gold, art and antiques, run by Boris Yeltsin pal Yevgeni Bychkov. The Russian government had decided to unload some of the rough and polished stones it had been accumulating for a long time, probably since 1955\u2014a hoard worth as much as $12 billion in the early 1990s, according to Chaim Even-Zohar, publisher in Ramat Gan, Israel of the influential trade journal ", "Diamond Intelligence Briefs", ". It is widely believed that Leviev became a primary means of liquidating the stockpile. What's more, the stockpile contained some of the most precious stones in the world, 100 carats and larger, says Richard Wake-Walker, a cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants. \"The incredible quality we were seeing couldn't come from a year's mining,\" says Barry Berg, vice president of international sales for William Goldberg Diamond, a Manhattan firm that took advantage of the unparalleled deluge. By 1997 a significant portion of that stockpile was gone.", "Was all that liquidation licit? \"That's what state reserves are for,\" says Rudakov, who is now chairman of a Norilsk Nickel unit. \"When a country is in distress it can sell off those reserves.\"", "Clearly, though, there were less legitimate uses. \"There were one or more Kremlin slush funds, and a variety of questionable benefits were distributed,\" says John Helmer, a veteran U.S. business correspondent in Russia. \"Some of the proceeds went to electioneering, some to offshore accounts and some to individual pockets.\" In 1998 Thomas Kneir, then a deputy assistant director at the FBI, testified before a House banking subcommittee about the smuggling of proceeds from the sale of Russia's state assets, including diamonds, into foreign accounts during the loosey-goosey days of early capitalism. Kneir cited the Golden ADA affair, in which rough diamonds worth $170 million were shipped from Russia to a plant it set up in San Francisco, where they were to be cut and polished. But, says Matthew Hart, author of ", "Diamond", ", the gems and cash disappeared along the way, spent on luxury homes and political payoffs. (Bychkov, charged with abuse of power in connection with Golden ADA, was later pardoned by Yeltsin.)", "If he was the conduit for many transactions, Leviev would have raked it in. \"You buy it today, sell it an hour later and get paid tomorrow,\" explains Manhattan buyer Barry Berg. Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly.", "Whatever he was up to during the Yeltsin years, he kept a low profile. Leviev avoided being identified with the \"Family,\" a group of newly hatched tycoons who tried to convert their economic influence into political power. A smart move, because when Putin became president, he marginalized some Family members, like Boris Berezovsky. Leviev had kept close ties with Putin, brokering meetings for the first time between the new Russian president and prominent Israeli politicos.", "While De Beers struggled in the mid-1990s to deal with Leviev in Russia, it had another problem on its hands closer to home: blood diamonds, the ones that paid for knives and guns. Angola, the world's third-largest producer of rough diamonds, was overrun with rebel forces opposed to President Dos Santos. The rebels took control of the diamond territories and flooded the market with up to $1.2 billion in diamonds a year. De Beers had little choice but to buy the stuff or risk losing its grip on prices, according to the London-based group Global Witness.", "Blood diamonds became a PR migraine for De Beers. In 1998 the United Nations slapped sanctions on the buying of Angolan diamonds from the rebels; a widely circulated report by Global Witness singled out De Beers for \"operat[ing] with an extraordinary lack of accountability.\" Under pressure, the Syndicate closed its buying offices in Angola and the war-pocked Democratic Republic of Congo, while continuing to explore in Angola.", "Leviev had already made a mark in Angola in 1996 when he came through with a $60 million investment, in exchange for 16% of Angola's largest diamond mine, after the government took it back from the rebels. Alrosa, a partner, couldn't come up with the cash. \"Dos Santos said I was the only one who helped his country,\" says Leviev, who guarded his mines with former Israeli intelligence agents. (He and the president bonded, says a report from the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, over their knowledge of Russian and mutual loathing of De Beers.) Leviev also offered to generate more state revenues and promised to cut down on illegal exports. To sweeten the pot, he gave the Angolan government a 51% share of Angola Selling Corp., or Ascorp, the exclusive buyer of Angolan rough diamonds. (Industry insiders whisper that Isabella Dos Santos, the president's daughter, has a separate stake in Ascorp. Leviev says he knows nothing of it.)", "There's more to the story than Leviev cares to discuss. A friend of his, Arcady Gaydamak, an alleged arms dealer with Israeli and Russian citizenship, was an adviser to Dos Santos. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the mid 1990s Gaydamak (wanted in France for illegal arms trafficking) negotiated a forgiveness of Angolan debt to Russia, in exchange for arms. In January 2000, a month after Leviev's Ascorp was awarded the exclusive on Angola's diamonds, Gaydamak bought 15% of Leviev's Africa Israel Investments. Within a year Leviev bought back Gaydamak's stake. A quid pro quo? \"He offered to sell me the shares at a good price,\" says Leviev. \"This was a time before Mr. Gaydamak had legal problems.\" While the two are no longer business associates, they remain chums.", "Leviev apparently delivered on his word to Dos Santos: The government's reported tax collections from diamond sales jumped to $62 million last year from $10 million in 1998. A lot more than that was smuggled out of the country, contends Even-Zohar. Buying up $1 billion worth of Angolan rough diamonds a year strained Leviev, who was under constant pressure to unload the minerals quickly. He couldn't consistently offer miners the best prices. \"So diggers knew they could get far more for their stones, and that led to rampant smuggling,\" says Even-Zohar.", "That may help explain why Leviev lost his Angolan exclusive this summer. When asked about being dropped, Leviev shrugs. \"Don't count me out yet.\"", "He had left a long trail of ill will with De Beers in Angola. In March of 2000 the Syndicate persuaded a Belgian judge to seize a small diamond shipment that turned out to be Leviev's. He successfully petitioned to have the stones returned a few months later. De Beers still contends the 1998 contract with Leviev's Ascorp is invalid and is trying to get its Angolan rights restored and recover $92 million it says it is owed by the Dos Santos government.", "The Syndicate had reason to fight. Ascorp's deal meant that for the first time, De Beers would have had to sell the output of its own mines to someone else\u2014in this case, its archenemy. By May 2001 the company exited Angola entirely.", "Next flashpoint: Namibia, a country rich with diamonds that De Beers has mined since Ernest Oppenheimer bought the concessions after World War I. But like Russia, Namibia wanted to process its own rocks, so in 2000 it forced producers to sell a regular supply of rough diamonds to domestic cutters. De Beers balked, but later relented and built a cutting factory with Namibia\u2014but supplies it with rough from its own London offices.", "Again Leviev exploited the situation. In 2000 he paid $30 million for 37% of Namibian Minerals Corp. (Namco), an offshore diamond mining outfit. As part of the deal, he agreed to open a polishing factory on the Namibian coast. Later, when Namco's mining equipment broke down, Leviev feuded with his partners when they refused to put up more money for repairs. So he got even, forcing the company into bankruptcy, then buying all its mining concessions for a pittance\u2014an estimated $3 million.", "His partnerships in Russia, Angola and Namibia represent part of Leviev's play for direct ownership of rough supplies\u2014geopolitically diversified. He has recently bought a piece of Camafuca in northeast Angola and a diamond exploration licence in Russia's Ural mountains. (Allegedly, he unsuccessfully bid for a piece of Alexkor, South Africa's state-owned diamond mining company. He also failed in an attempt to trade his Namco concessions for a chunk of Trans Hex Group, a publicly traded mining outfit based in Cape Town; one likely stumbling block was his links to Arcady Gaydamak. Leviev denies making either bid.) If Russia's Alrosa, still a state-owned asset, should be privatized, Putin pal Leviev would certainly be on any short list of potential buyers.", "Leviev boasts: \"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" But De Beers has been moving vertically, too. Its loss of market dominance pushed it into the retail end. It formed a joint venture with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, unveiled in 2000, to create an upscale brand that would fetch a premium over unbranded diamonds. Each partner put up $200 million, hoping for the kind of margins that would compensate for the loss of share in the mining side of the business. But so far, all it's done is create collateral damage. In July De Beers dropped 35 of its 120 longtime sightholders (adding 10 new ones), raising rampant speculation that it was keeping its best supplies for its retail operation. De Beers vigorously denies this and says it cut the sightholders following its \"objective [review] process.\" (Still, the move created quite a stir in Manhattan's 47th Street Diamond District; see sidebar above).", "De Beers LV, as the partnership is known, hasn't made the expected splash. So far there's just one stand-alone store, on London's Bond Street. A planned Madison Avenue store has been delayed indefinitely.", "Still, the De Beers-driven branding trend has caught fire. Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with fashion house Escada to create the 12-sided \"Escada cut\" for its signature jewelry line. Leo Schachter Diamonds, a Tel Aviv-based sightholder, spent at least $5 million to advertise its 66-faceted Leo diamond in magazines like ", "People", " and ", "Vanity Fair", ". While Tiffany patented the Lucida diamond, a 50-facet square cut, New York's William Goldberg produced the antique-looking Ashoka variety. Even Leviev is launching his own high-end jewelry line, dubbed the Vivid Collection, hoarding his best stones for pieces priced from $50,000 to a few million dollars.", "Leviev is also moving beyond the ancient game of one-upmanship\u2014and beyond the dirty business of diamonds. You see it in his latest investments. With partners, he's financing $1 billion in real estate development in Russia over the next four years, including three office buildings in central Moscow, and expects to put up a similar amount for office and residential complexes in New York City, Dallas and San Antonio. You can also see it in his political activities. In June he brokered a meeting in Moscow between Putin and American Jewish leaders, including James Tisch, chief executive of Loews Corp., to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.", "Perhaps his religious philanthropy is his ultimate reach for legitimacy. Lately he has expanded his Chabad initiatives, once confined to Russia and other former Soviet republics, to the West. This year he is setting up a school in Dresden to teach nonreligious Jewish emigres about the faith. Last year he opened a new school in Queens, N.Y. that caters to 350 Jewish students whose families formerly lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. \"It's about staying true to the legacy of my father,\" he says. \"All I want is for people in these places to know they are Jewish.\" A moment later he is whisked through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where a caravan of heavily guarded SUVs awaits.", "MORE FROM FORBES"]},

It's the American Dream of starting from humble beginnings, working hard, fighting against adversity and making something of yourself. Brian Garish embodies this ethos. Though, his version is a little different. Garish went from stocking shelves at Walgreens to becoming the president of Banfield Pet Hospital, the largest pet hospital chain in the U.S.", "He began his career stocking shelves at the local Walgreens pharmacy during high school. Garish dropped out of college after only a six-month stint when he was 18 years old. It was a trying time. Back at home with his parents, he felt lost without any direction. As he explains, ", "\"At the time, I didn't see the value of sitting in class to hear about business", ". I wanted to do the work.\" A mentor at the pharmacy chain suggested that Garish focus on working hard and advancing within the organization, especially since he didn\u2019t have any other alternatives. ", "Garish gave it everything he had. Over time, he received the equivalent of an MBA by asking questions, watching to see what worked or failed in the stores, emulating the actions of successful employees and honing his interpersonal skills, all as he kept climbing the corporate ladder. ", "The bottom-up path Garish took made him think and act differently about leadership. The experience of starting on one of the lowest rungs and working his way up the ladder taught him humility and empathy. He understands the importance of hard work with low pay. ", "After serving about 12 years as a manager at Walgreens, then spending more than 10 years rising from district and regional manager roles to area vice president at CVS Health, Garish is now the president of Banfield Pet Hospital, the industry\u2019s leading provider of preventive care, a division of Mars Inc. His highest priority at the company is creating a high-performing, inclusive culture for 19,000-plus associates at over 1,000 hospitals across the country. ", "His hands-on retail experience taught him empathy. He actively listened to what customers and staff members wanted and needed during his days in store management. This made him think differently. For example, the vets and the workers wore drab scrubs that only came in two boring colors. In his ", "Banter with Brian", " series, a companywide invitation to connect employees with their CEO over Instagram, Garish listened to his team and scrapped the humdrum scrubs, announcing it in an Instagram ", "dance video", ".", "In an effort to show appreciation for his hard-working team, Garish and Banfield proudly launched BANDtogether\u2014a series of multi-sector discussions to generate ideas and actions, in response to three societywide challenges.

By breaking down stigmas and addressing mental health head-on, organizations have an opportunity to positively impact not just the workplace, but society as a whole.", "Empowering women:", " Since the pandemic took hold, more than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce. This is a clear signal that we must collectively do better to address the challenges this essential population faces. With 86% of its workforce being women, Banfield is uniquely invested in supporting and empowering women in the workplace. ", "People who want to become veterinarians do it for love. Compared to other medical professionals, like doctors and surgeons, the pay is relatively low. However, the required veterinary education is expensive. Veterinarians have the highest student-debt-to-income rate of any profession. Garish said about this issue, \u201cYou have people becoming vets, who only want to make the world a better place for pets, and they\u2019re strapped with this burden. We are proud to be one of 4% of companies that are actually paying down student debt.\u201d The program has contributed around $15 million to pay off debt for veterinary professionals, while helping to refinance more than $16 million in student loans. ", "Being a vet or working in the pet-care industry has big ups and downs. One moment a family with young children brings in their newly adopted puppy for a wellness visit, then the next patient the vet attends to needs to be put down. This and other heartbreaking patient visits can do harm on a medical profession\u2019s psyche. ", "Garish pointed out a sobering statistic, \u201cOne out of six veterinarians contemplate suicide on at least one occasion, something they refer to in the industry as compassion fatigue. We asked ourselves what we can do about that, so we hired a mental-health professional on staff, as well as launching mental-health pilot programs.\u201d Banfield launched the first suicide-prevention training designed specifically for veterinary professionals, as part of its holistic commitment to the health and well-being. The training is also available for free to the entire veterinary profession.", "In the interview, Garish offered sage advice from the wisdom he accumulated over the decades working in retail environments. He believes that you should listen to the people who are closest to your consumer, not only those sitting in your corporate office. Strategy is wasted without empathy. Offering hope, help and optimism is more powerful than any education or knowledge. ", "You control culture\u2014which matters\u2014whether you are the janitor or CEO. Build trust through two-way dialogue. Garish advocates to look outside your profession for ideas. He acknowledges that he doesn\u2019t have all of the answers and he doesn't pretend to. ", "He also calls for a fun-centric workplace with a vibrant open-floor plan, luxurious gym and cafeteria and plenty of toys and games for both employees and the furry friends they bring to the office. ", "His efforts are effective. Since becoming president in 2017, Banfield has achieved the lowest turnover in its history, while simultaneously averaging double-digit year-over-year growth. Under his tenure, Banfield, a multibillion organization, skyrocketed over 50%.", "Garish ultimately went back to college. Instead of getting a business degree and MBA, he once again took a nontraditional turn by obtaining a diploma in philosophy from Indiana University. He serves on a number of nonprofit boards, including Metropolitan Family Services, Columbia River Economic Development Council and the Banfield Foundation. In his free time, Garish spends time with his two cats, Ashin and Kenji."]},

He restored this town's only remaining synagogue, which the Nazis had turned into an arms depot and communists converted to a cinema. Now a ragtag klezmer band serenades him as photographers snap pictures and boys perform a traditional Hasidic dance in his honor. Across some 400 villages in Russia and the former Soviet republics this scene has been replayed countless times. Leviev is a 47-year-old, Uzbeki-born Israeli citizen and devout Lubavitcher who gives away at least $30 million a year in order to return lost Jews to the flock.", "This little-known billionaire is also the scourge of De Beers, the giant miner and marketer of diamonds, known as the \"Syndicate.\" Leviev was once a sightholder, one of a few exclusive direct buyers of De Beers rough diamonds. Today he is the world's largest cutter and polisher of the precious gems and a primary source of rough stones to other cutters, polishers and jewelry makers around the globe. Those who have watched his rise over the last three decades say it was his intense hatred of De Beers that fueled him. He bristled under the Syndicate's high-handed treatment of buyers, who were given boxes of rough diamonds at take-it-or-leave-it prices and risked being permanently cut off if they balked.", "Leviev won't openly criticize his former South African business partner. But his defiance seems thinly disguised. \"I'm not going to let anyone else tell me how to run my business,\" he says. \"I grew up in the Soviet Union. I knew what it was to be afraid. I can remember being beaten regularly by the bullies at school, and I said to myself I would never be afraid of anybody or anything again.\"", "Indeed, he has taken significant business away from De Beers in Russia and Angola\u2014two of the world's largest producers of rough diamonds in terms of value. Leviev has not humbled the once-mighty Syndicate alone. But his defiance has inspired others, like Rio Tinto, owner of Australia's Argyle mine, which bypassed De Beers for the first time in 1996 to sell its 42 million carats directly to polishers in Antwerp. In the early 1990s the Russian government began selling some of its rough supply to others, despite its longtime exclusive deal with De Beers. When miners discovered massive diamond reserves in Canada's Northwest Territories, De Beers had to scramble for a piece. Its share of the rough-diamond market, 80% five years ago, has been cut to 60%.", "The reason Leviev is such a threat is that he has profoundly shaken the tradition-bound diamond business. Until recently De Beers had a virtual chokehold on world supplies, determining who could buy uncut stones\u2014and at what quantities and quality\u2014and where the cutting centers were allowed to prosper. Leviev pulled an end run around the cartel, dealing directly with diamond-producing governments and shattering De Beers' all-important relationship with sightholders. He also became the industry's first diamond dealer with his finger on every facet of production, from mining and cutting to polishing and retailing, capturing profits at every stage.", "Trumping De Beers, Leviev has become very rich. He owns 100% of his diamond business, Lev Leviev Group, and a controlling stake in Africa Israel Investments. The latter is a Yehud, Israel-based conglomerate whose holdings include: commercial real estate in Prague and London; Gottex, a swimwear company; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S.; 173 7-Elevens in New Mexico and Texas; a 33% stake in Cross Israel Highway, that nation's first toll road; and an 85% share of Vash Telecanal, Israel's Russian-language TV channel. Leviev also owns a gold mine in Kazakhstan, pieces of two diamond mines in Angola and mining licenses in the Urals and Namibia. He's probably worth $2 billion.", "A part of that wealth comes from exploiting political connections\u2014which has created enmity and suspicion. A recent example: When Leviev was preparing a bid for 40% of Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the banks supporting him pulled out at the last moment. Sources say it was a lack of transparency in Leviev's business. Even if his hands are clean, Leviev has dealt with people whose mitts are dirty. His ubiquitous brigade of burly armed guards isn't just for show.", "Some of Russia's Jewish establishment resent Leviev's pushing his own brand of Hasidism. He has drawn fire for seeing to it that a Lubavitch rabbi, born in Italy and educated in America, was granted citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Leviev installed him as the country's chief rabbi, though the nation already had one. He's playing with fire, critics say, by aligning himself so closely with Putin. Should the president turn on him, Leviev's Jewish activities could be seen as violating the promise Russia's oligarchs made to Putin to stay out of politics in order to keep their assets\u2014many of which were notoriously acquired in the early 1990s.", "There's no denying Leviev's clout. His relationship to Putin dates back to 1992, when the president, then a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, authorized the opening of the first new Jewish school in the city in half a century (financed by Leviev) after the mayor hesitated to do it. Leviev has also become something of a go-to guy between Israel and central Asian countries, enlisting the secular regimes in those mainly Islamic states in the fight against fundamentalist terror groups. Leviev, who now lives in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Israel, is a close associate of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the presidents of Kazakhstan and his native Uzbekistan. Among his pals in Africa are presidents Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia.", "Leviev grew up in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Though under communism his family was committed to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, and all the males, Leviev included, learned to perform ritual circumcisions in secret. Leviev's father Avner was a successful textile merchant and a collector of rare Persian carpets. After seven years of waiting, the family emigrated to Israel in 1971, having converted their wealth into $1 million in rough diamonds, which they smuggled out of the country. But when they tried to unload them in Israel, they were told the diamonds were of inferior quality, worth only $200,000. Leviev, 15 at the time, vowed to right the wrong. Over his father's objections, he left yeshiva and a life of religious education to take up diamond-cutting.", "He opened his own cutting factory in 1977\u2014when speculation in the burgeoning Israeli diamond market went unchecked. Most cutters held inventory, betting on ever-rising prices. When the market collapsed three years later, banks stopped extending credit and many cutters went bust. Leviev hadn't borrowed against his inventory and was in good enough shape to expand to 12 small factories over the next five years. Scrambling to find enough rough diamonds, he flew frequently to London, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Siberia. He also adapted laser technology and acquired cutting software\u2014a revolutionary innovation at the time\u2014to capture more value from his precious supply. Later his cutters could produce digital 3-D models of various diamond cuts, taking into account imperfections, size, weight and shape before touching the stone. \"Part of his genius,\" says Charles Wyndham, cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants and a former director of De Beers' selling arm, \"was marrying cutting-edge technology to exactly what the market wanted.\"", "In 1987 De Beers invited Leviev to become a sightholder, a plum position granted to fewer than 150 people. By then he was one of Israel's largest manufacturers of polished stones. Two years later Russia's state-run diamond mining and selling group, now called Alrosa, asked Leviev to help it set up its own cutting factories\u2014the first time any rough diamonds were finished in the country of their origin\u2014in a joint venture called Ruis. (For decades De Beers has been channeling all rough diamonds through its Diamond Trading Co. in London before reselling them to sightholders at a markup; a diamond mined in, say, Africa traveled halfway around the world before it was resold to a sightholder in Africa.) Today, Leviev owns 100% of Ruis, which cuts $140 million worth of diamonds a year, and polishing operations, including one in Perm, Russia, another in Armenia.", "Leviev horned in on the business by cultivating a cozy relationship with Valery Rudakov, who under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ran Alrosa. The partnership opened the Kremlin door for Leviev. \"I never spoke about business with Gorbachev,\" Leviev insists. \"I talked to him about opening Jewish schools where there had been none for 70 years.\" But he probably confirmed Rudakov's suspicions (and those of Gorby) that De Beers was lowballing the country on the value of its gems.", "Leviev's deal gave him a piece of Russia's rough-diamond supply, and gave De Beers fits. By 1995 it had had enough of this upstart and booted him from the sightholders' circle. It is widely believed that Leviev, perhaps anticipating the Syndicate's retaliation, had already secured rough supply from Gokhran, Russia's repository of gems, gold, art and antiques, run by Boris Yeltsin pal Yevgeni Bychkov. The Russian government had decided to unload some of the rough and polished stones it had been accumulating for a long time, probably since 1955\u2014a hoard worth as much as $12 billion in the early 1990s, according to Chaim Even-Zohar, publisher in Ramat Gan, Israel of the influential trade journal ", "Diamond Intelligence Briefs", ". It is widely believed that Leviev became a primary means of liquidating the stockpile. What's more, the stockpile contained some of the most precious stones in the world, 100 carats and larger, says Richard Wake-Walker, a cofounder of WWW International Diamond Consultants. \"The incredible quality we were seeing couldn't come from a year's mining,\" says Barry Berg, vice president of international sales for William Goldberg Diamond, a Manhattan firm that took advantage of the unparalleled deluge. By 1997 a significant portion of that stockpile was gone.", "Was all that liquidation licit? \"That's what state reserves are for,\" says Rudakov, who is now chairman of a Norilsk Nickel unit. \"When a country is in distress it can sell off those reserves.\"", "Clearly, though, there were less legitimate uses. \"There were one or more Kremlin slush funds, and a variety of questionable benefits were distributed,\" says John Helmer, a veteran U.S. business correspondent in Russia. \"Some of the proceeds went to electioneering, some to offshore accounts and some to individual pockets.\" In 1998 Thomas Kneir, then a deputy assistant director at the FBI, testified before a House banking subcommittee about the smuggling of proceeds from the sale of Russia's state assets, including diamonds, into foreign accounts during the loosey-goosey days of early capitalism. Kneir cited the Golden ADA affair, in which rough diamonds worth $170 million were shipped from Russia to a plant it set up in San Francisco, where they were to be cut and polished. But, says Matthew Hart, author of ", "Diamond", ", the gems and cash disappeared along the way, spent on luxury homes and political payoffs. (Bychkov, charged with abuse of power in connection with Golden ADA, was later pardoned by Yeltsin.)", "If he was the conduit for many transactions, Leviev would have raked it in. \"You buy it today, sell it an hour later and get paid tomorrow,\" explains Manhattan buyer Barry Berg. Leviev denies any role in the liquidation of Russia's stockpile. \"That's cheap gossip,\" he says flatly.", "Whatever he was up to during the Yeltsin years, he kept a low profile. Leviev avoided being identified with the \"Family,\" a group of newly hatched tycoons who tried to convert their economic influence into political power. A smart move, because when Putin became president, he marginalized some Family members, like Boris Berezovsky. Leviev had kept close ties with Putin, brokering meetings for the first time between the new Russian president and prominent Israeli politicos.", "While De Beers struggled in the mid-1990s to deal with Leviev in Russia, it had another problem on its hands closer to home: blood diamonds, the ones that paid for knives and guns. Angola, the world's third-largest producer of rough diamonds, was overrun with rebel forces opposed to President Dos Santos. The rebels took control of the diamond territories and flooded the market with up to $1.2 billion in diamonds a year. De Beers had little choice but to buy the stuff or risk losing its grip on prices, according to the London-based group Global Witness.", "Blood diamonds became a PR migraine for De Beers. In 1998 the United Nations slapped sanctions on the buying of Angolan diamonds from the rebels; a widely circulated report by Global Witness singled out De Beers for \"operat[ing] with an extraordinary lack of accountability.\" Under pressure, the Syndicate closed its buying offices in Angola and the war-pocked Democratic Republic of Congo, while continuing to explore in Angola.", "Leviev had already made a mark in Angola in 1996 when he came through with a $60 million investment, in exchange for 16% of Angola's largest diamond mine, after the government took it back from the rebels. Alrosa, a partner, couldn't come up with the cash. \"Dos Santos said I was the only one who helped his country,\" says Leviev, who guarded his mines with former Israeli intelligence agents. (He and the president bonded, says a report from the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, over their knowledge of Russian and mutual loathing of De Beers.) Leviev also offered to generate more state revenues and promised to cut down on illegal exports. To sweeten the pot, he gave the Angolan government a 51% share of Angola Selling Corp., or Ascorp, the exclusive buyer of Angolan rough diamonds. (Industry insiders whisper that Isabella Dos Santos, the president's daughter, has a separate stake in Ascorp. Leviev says he knows nothing of it.)", "There's more to the story than Leviev cares to discuss. A friend of his, Arcady Gaydamak, an alleged arms dealer with Israeli and Russian citizenship, was an adviser to Dos Santos. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the mid 1990s Gaydamak (wanted in France for illegal arms trafficking) negotiated a forgiveness of Angolan debt to Russia, in exchange for arms. In January 2000, a month after Leviev's Ascorp was awarded the exclusive on Angola's diamonds, Gaydamak bought 15% of Leviev's Africa Israel Investments. Within a year Leviev bought back Gaydamak's stake. A quid pro quo? \"He offered to sell me the shares at a good price,\" says Leviev. \"This was a time before Mr. Gaydamak had legal problems.\" While the two are no longer business associates, they remain chums.", "Leviev apparently delivered on his word to Dos Santos: The government's reported tax collections from diamond sales jumped to $62 million last year from $10 million in 1998. A lot more than that was smuggled out of the country, contends Even-Zohar. Buying up $1 billion worth of Angolan rough diamonds a year strained Leviev, who was under constant pressure to unload the minerals quickly. He couldn't consistently offer miners the best prices. \"So diggers knew they could get far more for their stones, and that led to rampant smuggling,\" says Even-Zohar.", "That may help explain why Leviev lost his Angolan exclusive this summer. When asked about being dropped, Leviev shrugs. \"Don't count me out yet.\"", "He had left a long trail of ill will with De Beers in Angola. In March of 2000 the Syndicate persuaded a Belgian judge to seize a small diamond shipment that turned out to be Leviev's. He successfully petitioned to have the stones returned a few months later. De Beers still contends the 1998 contract with Leviev's Ascorp is invalid and is trying to get its Angolan rights restored and recover $92 million it says it is owed by the Dos Santos government.", "The Syndicate had reason to fight. Ascorp's deal meant that for the first time, De Beers would have had to sell the output of its own mines to someone else\u2014in this case, its archenemy. By May 2001 the company exited Angola entirely.", "Next flashpoint: Namibia, a country rich with diamonds that De Beers has mined since Ernest Oppenheimer bought the concessions after World War I. But like Russia, Namibia wanted to process its own rocks, so in 2000 it forced producers to sell a regular supply of rough diamonds to domestic cutters. De Beers balked, but later relented and built a cutting factory with Namibia\u2014but supplies it with rough from its own London offices.", "Again Leviev exploited the situation. In 2000 he paid $30 million for 37% of Namibian Minerals Corp. (Namco), an offshore diamond mining outfit. As part of the deal, he agreed to open a polishing factory on the Namibian coast. Later, when Namco's mining equipment broke down, Leviev feuded with his partners when they refused to put up more money for repairs. So he got even, forcing the company into bankruptcy, then buying all its mining concessions for a pittance\u2014an estimated $3 million.", "His partnerships in Russia, Angola and Namibia represent part of Leviev's play for direct ownership of rough supplies\u2014geopolitically diversified. He has recently bought a piece of Camafuca in northeast Angola and a diamond exploration licence in Russia's Ural mountains. (Allegedly, he unsuccessfully bid for a piece of Alexkor, South Africa's state-owned diamond mining company. He also failed in an attempt to trade his Namco concessions for a chunk of Trans Hex Group, a publicly traded mining outfit based in Cape Town; one likely stumbling block was his links to Arcady Gaydamak. Leviev denies making either bid.) If Russia's Alrosa, still a state-owned asset, should be privatized, Putin pal Leviev would certainly be on any short list of potential buyers.", "Leviev boasts: \"I am the only vertically integrated diamond dealer in the world.\" But De Beers has been moving vertically, too. Its loss of market dominance pushed it into the retail end. It formed a joint venture with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, unveiled in 2000, to create an upscale brand that would fetch a premium over unbranded diamonds. Each partner put up $200 million, hoping for the kind of margins that would compensate for the loss of share in the mining side of the business. But so far, all it's done is create collateral damage. In July De Beers dropped 35 of its 120 longtime sightholders (adding 10 new ones), raising rampant speculation that it was keeping its best supplies for its retail operation. De Beers vigorously denies this and says it cut the sightholders following its \"objective [review] process.\" (Still, the move created quite a stir in Manhattan's 47th Street Diamond District; see sidebar above).", "De Beers LV, as the partnership is known, hasn't made the expected splash. So far there's just one stand-alone store, on London's Bond Street. A planned Madison Avenue store has been delayed indefinitely.", "Still, the De Beers-driven branding trend has caught fire. Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with fashion house Escada to create the 12-sided \"Escada cut\" for its signature jewelry line. Leo Schachter Diamonds, a Tel Aviv-based sightholder, spent at least $5 million to advertise its 66-faceted Leo diamond in magazines like ", "People", " and ", "Vanity Fair", ". While Tiffany patented the Lucida diamond, a 50-facet square cut, New York's William Goldberg produced the antique-looking Ashoka variety. Even Leviev is launching his own high-end jewelry line, dubbed the Vivid Collection, hoarding his best stones for pieces priced from $50,000 to a few million dollars.", "Leviev is also moving beyond the ancient game of one-upmanship\u2014and beyond the dirty business of diamonds. You see it in his latest investments. With partners, he's financing $1 billion in real estate development in Russia over the next four years, including three office buildings in central Moscow, and expects to put up a similar amount for office and residential complexes in New York City, Dallas and San Antonio. You can also see it in his political activities. In June he brokered a meeting in Moscow between Putin and American Jewish leaders, including James Tisch, chief executive of Loews Corp., to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.", "Perhaps his religious philanthropy is his ultimate reach for legitimacy. Lately he has expanded his Chabad initiatives, once confined to Russia and other former Soviet republics, to the West. This year he is setting up a school in Dresden to teach nonreligious Jewish emigres about the faith. Last year he opened a new school in Queens, N.Y. that caters to 350 Jewish students whose families formerly lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. \"It's about staying true to the legacy of my father,\" he says. \"All I want is for people in these places to know they are Jewish.\" A moment later he is whisked through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where a caravan of heavily guarded SUVs awaits.", "MORE FROM FORBES"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/", "author_name": "Chase Peterson-Withorn", "author_contrib_type": "Forbes Staff", "author_subcontext_header": "Billionaires", "author_about": "I cover the most successful entrepreneurs doing the biggest deals on the planet.

Garish dropped out of college after only a six-month stint when he was 18 years old. It was a trying time. Back at home with his parents, he felt lost without any direction. As he explains, ", "\"At the time, I didn't see the value of sitting in class to hear about business", ". I wanted to do the work.\" A mentor at the pharmacy chain suggested that Garish focus on working hard and advancing within the organization, especially since he didn\u2019t have any other alternatives.

", "The bottom-up path Garish took made him think and act differently about leadership. The experience of starting on one of the lowest rungs and working his way up the ladder taught him humility and empathy. He understands the importance of hard work with low pay. ", "After serving about 12 years as a manager at Walgreens, then spending more than 10 years rising from district and regional manager roles to area vice president at CVS Health, Garish is now the president of Banfield Pet Hospital, the industry\u2019s leading provider of preventive care, a division of Mars Inc. His highest priority at the company is creating a high-performing, inclusive culture for 19,000-plus associates at over 1,000 hospitals across the country. ", "His hands-on retail experience taught him empathy. He actively listened to what customers and staff members wanted and needed during his days in store management. This made him think differently. For example, the vets and the workers wore drab scrubs that only came in two boring colors.

This is a clear signal that we must collectively do better to address the challenges this essential population faces. With 86% of its workforce being women, Banfield is uniquely invested in supporting and empowering women in the workplace. ", "People who want to become veterinarians do it for love. Compared to other medical professionals, like doctors and surgeons, the pay is relatively low. However, the required veterinary education is expensive. Veterinarians have the highest student-debt-to-income rate of any profession.

We are proud to be one of 4% of companies that are actually paying down student debt.\u201d The program has contributed around $15 million to pay off debt for veterinary professionals, while helping to refinance more than $16 million in student loans. ", "Being a vet or working in the pet-care industry has big ups and downs. One moment a family with young children brings in their newly adopted puppy for a wellness visit, then the next patient the vet attends to needs to be put down. This and other heartbreaking patient visits can do harm on a medical profession\u2019s psyche. ", "Garish pointed out a sobering statistic, \u201cOne out of six veterinarians contemplate suicide on at least one occasion, something they refer to in the industry as compassion fatigue. We asked ourselves what we can do about that, so we hired a mental-health professional on staff, as well as launching mental-health pilot programs.\u201d Banfield launched the first suicide-prevention training designed specifically for veterinary professionals, as part of its holistic commitment to the health and well-being. The training is also available for free to the entire veterinary profession.", "In the interview, Garish offered sage advice from the wisdom he accumulated over the decades working in retail environments. He believes that you should listen to the people who are closest to your consumer, not only those sitting in your corporate office. Strategy is wasted without empathy. Offering hope, help and optimism is more powerful than any education or knowledge. ", "You control culture\u2014which matters\u2014whether you are the janitor or CEO. Build trust through two-way dialogue. Garish advocates to look outside your profession for ideas. He acknowledges that he doesn\u2019t have all of the answers and he doesn't pretend to. ", "He also calls for a fun-centric workplace with a vibrant open-floor plan, luxurious gym and cafeteria and plenty of toys and games for both employees and the furry friends they bring to the office. ", "His efforts are effective. Since becoming president in 2017, Banfield has achieved the lowest turnover in its history, while simultaneously averaging double-digit year-over-year growth. Under his tenure, Banfield, a multibillion organization, skyrocketed over 50%.", "Garish ultimately went back to college. Instead of getting a business degree and MBA, he once again took a nontraditional turn by obtaining a diploma in philosophy from Indiana University.

However, the time and energy requirements of having both a career and a family, in particular for women, have changed over time and have a rich and important history.

Yet every day remains a constant challenge of taking care of an endless array of tasks and parenting emergencies.", "But for many couples, because high-powered careers require early time intensive investments for later success, there becomes a trade off for dual-career couples where money is left on the table if everything is shared 50-50 at home. Ultimately, one parent needs to be on call at home, and this still most often is the woman. As Claudia explains so well in this interview, it is greedy work and the structure of work and careers that remain a barrier for many women hoping to be able to balance a high powered career and family. Finding a way to address the demands of greedy work and couple equity are very likely crucial to help women achieve equity in the workplace.", "Why did you write the book ", "Career & Family", "? ", "I had, for many years, been writing about two aspects of women\u2019s lives. ", "The first is the evolution of women in the labor force. It addresses why women have become half of the US labor force when they were perhaps 10% in the nineteenth century. What has been the interplay between women\u2019s employment and their age at marriage? And how did the notion that women could have a career and a family evolve? So, the first issue is centered on the history of women, work, and family.", "The other part concerns equity: equity between couples and gender equity in terms of pay, promotion, and occupation. Gender gaps in earnings and employment have narrowed considerably but remain. ", "Why?", "At some point, I realized that these two parts of the story must be brought together. ", "The book", " emphasizes the enormous progress we have made. Yet, it also demonstrates what is preventing us from going the \u201clast mile.\u201d It is only because we have made enormous progress in education and employment, and that many of the obvious barriers have been taken down, that the reasons for the remaining differences have become so clear.", "The book was begun long before the pandemic, but it took on new urgency with the lockdown. Everything that I had been saying about the reasons for the remaining differences became clearer during the pandemic. When schools closed, burdens increased for all parents. Fortunate workers sheltered at home and could retain their jobs. The pandemic magnified the factors raised in the book\u2014the importance of flexible work, the career cost of children to women, and the cost to women of couple inequity regarding unequal division of work and family.", "Based on your research how have things changed or not changed for women in the workplace?", "One first needs to know the period to locate change for women in the workplace. Change in women\u2019s labor force participation, occupations, and earnings have been stupendous since 1900. Change has also been enormous since 1950 and even since 1970. But change in some areas has not been large enough since, say, 2000. The labor force participation rate of women\u2014of just about all education groups and almost all age groups\u2014has been stuck. (The only group of women who have experienced significant increased participation are women older than around 55 years in the period from 1990 to around the 2010s.) The gender earnings gap has narrowed somewhat in the last two decades, but not by as much as it did before. That may be understandable since it narrowed by a lot. But it does appear a bit stuck. Why that is the case is part of the book. The other part of the book concerns the change that came before. Let me discuss that a bit.", "The book divides the past century or more of college graduate women into five distinct groups and shows the enormous changes that occurred as we move from one to the next.", "The five groups differed greatly in their outcomes\u2014their marriage rates, their birth rates, their occupations, and their employment. They shifted from being able to have ", "either", " a career or a family to expecting to have ", "both", " a career and a family.", "Understanding this history clears the air and allows us to see the next steps. The history is needed to comprehend how barriers and norms first appear and later disappear, and how change in the greater economy and society impacts women.", "One part of gender differences that gets considerable attention today is the earnings gap. We generally express the gender earnings gap as a single number (by \u201cwe\u201d I mean the US Bureau of Labor Statistics). It is expressed as the ratio of female to male weekly earnings for those working full-time, year-round. Furthermore, the ratio is the median woman\u2019s earnings divided by that of the median man. That\u2019s a mouthful. The ratio is less than the actual numbers because there is some attempt to control for hours worked and to trim the long right tail (earnings at the top) by using the median. ", "Expressed this way, there has been great progress, particularly in the 1980s. Much of the progress has come about because women\u2019s education and job experience greatly advanced relative to men\u2019s. They prepared themselves better for demanding jobs and they stayed in the workforce more. Thus, there has been considerable progress. ", "But there is also considerable frustration that there hasn\u2019t been more. The frustration has been expressed in terms of doing something about sexual harassment, biased managers, and absence of information on the salaries of others. But, although these are noble goals, they aren\u2019t going to make a big difference closing the remaining gender gap in earnings. The reason is that it is largely due to the impact of \u201cgreedy work\u201d and how couples adjust to it.", "What are the key challenges of improving what you call couple equity?", "The employee who is willing to work at all hours\u2014in the evenings, on weekends, on vacations, and is on-call at the office\u2014gets the bigger rewards. When these rewards are ", "disproportionate", " to the time put in, meaning that doubling the time, more than doubles the earnings, we get \u201cgreedy work.\u201d It isn\u2019t necessarily the number of hours, it is often \u201cwhich\u201d hours (weekend, vacation, dinner time, evening). And the relationship can also be dynamic and be part of the \u201cup or out\u201d system common to many high-end employments. Work more now, and get big rewards in the future (e.g., partner, tenure, first promotion).", "If an individual has children or some other family responsibilities, someone must be on-call at home, even if that person has a job. The \u201con-call at home\u201d person will take a position that has more flexibility and is less demanding and, in consequence, pays less even on a per hour basis.", "Women are generally the ones who are on-call at home. That\u2019s couple inequity. Thus, the flip side to couple inequity is gender inequality. Even same-sex couples with children encounter a strong pull toward this type of specialization and often jettison couple equity (but do not add to gender inequality). ", "Why can\u2019t dual-career families share the joys and duties of parenting equally? They could, but if they did, they would be leaving money on the table, often quite a lot. The 50-50 couple might be happier, but it would be poorer. ", "If work were less greedy the price of couple equity would be reduced. That can come about in a variety of ways some occurring organically and some because workers use voice and exit. For example, groups have been formed so that professionals in medical fields like pediatrics and obstetrics, can have more flexibility.", "The pandemic has lowered the cost of flexibility in various ways. Firms and workers have learned to use technologies that enable remote meetings,", " ", "including those with huge numbers of participants. Even though we\u2019ve had teleconferencing software since the 1990s, we didn\u2019t greatly depend on these tools until recently. The number of work hours may remain the same, but employees have more control over which hours are free, like the ones just before a child goes to bed or when the family eats dinner together. If a meeting with a client in Tokyo or Beijing can be effectively done without ever getting on a plane, the parent who needs to be home at night can take that job\u2014and that individual is likely to be a woman."]},

Similarly, Griff Green, whose current projects lean towards helping non-profit and public causes grow in the digital world, believes the hacker missed the chance to \u201cbe a hero.\u201d Says Green: \u201cHe really screwed the pooch...Reputation is way more valuable than money.\u201d", "Ironically, in a 2016 blog post, Hoenisch wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a white hat hacker by heart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0Twenty days later came the DAO attack.", "As I noted earlier,\u00a0after being sent a document laying out the evidence that he was the hacker and asking for comment for my book, Hoenisch wrote that my conclusion is \u201cfactually inaccurate.\u201d He said in that email he could give me more details\u2014and then did not respond to four requests for those details, nor to additional fact checking queries for this article.\u00a0In addition, after receiving the first document detailing the facts I\u2019d gathered, he deleted almost all his Twitter history (though I\u2019ve saved the relevant tweets).

This occurred a couple months after some crypto publications reported on Hosp\u2019s past affiliation with an Austrian multi-level marketing scheme. However, before hearing that evidence indicated Hoenisch was the DAO attacker, Hosp said his feeling had been that Hoenisch had perhaps pushed him out over jealousy that Hosp had sold bitcoin at the top of the bubble in late 2017, netting himself $20 million. Meanwhile, Hoenisch had kept all his crypto as the bubble \u2013 and his personal net worth \u2013 deflated.

Yes, he was. He was fascinated by that\u2026I lost money because of those stupid coins! I invested in them because of him, because he was so fascinated by them.\u201d He said that Hoenisch was also obsessed with building a Bitcoin/Monero \u201catomic swap\u201d \u2013 or a way to use smart contracts to swap between Bitcoin and the privacy coin Monero.

", "Claudia Goldin", ", Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard University, explains all of this in her thoughtfully researched book ", "Career & Family", ": Women\u2019s Century-Long Journey toward Equity", ".", "As Claudia notes in the interview that follows, \u201cThe history is needed to comprehend how barriers and norms first appear and later disappear, and how change in the greater economy and society impacts women.\u201d", "As the male part of a dual-career couple with young children, and the one who has more flexibility in his job as an academic (I get to drive an incredible v6 powered minivan \u2013 with \u201crocket boosters\u201d as my boys like say), I\u2019ve discovered that even though we don\u2019t have parents or other help nearby to help with our children, we\u2019re lucky that only one of us has the job with more \u201cgreedy work\u201d that requires her to consistently be present in person and round in the hospital as part of teaching students and residents. ", "As a family we\u2019ve found a way to balance \u201ccouple equity\u201d by taking on tasks that are essential in ways that can suit our work schedules, our personal strengths and capabilities, and trading off opportunities in multiple moves across the country to allow us each to have opportunities to move forward in our respective careers. Yet every day remains a constant challenge of taking care of an endless array of tasks and parenting emergencies.", "But for many couples, because high-powered careers require early time intensive investments for later success, there becomes a trade off for dual-career couples where money is left on the table if everything is shared 50-50 at home. Ultimately, one parent needs to be on call at home, and this still most often is the woman. As Claudia explains so well in this interview, it is greedy work and the structure of work and careers that remain a barrier for many women hoping to be able to balance a high powered career and family. Finding a way to address the demands of greedy work and couple equity are very likely crucial to help women achieve equity in the workplace.", "Why did you write the book ", "Career & Family", "? ", "I had, for many years, been writing about two aspects of women\u2019s lives. ", "The first is the evolution of women in the labor force. It addresses why women have become half of the US labor force when they were perhaps 10% in the nineteenth century. What has been the interplay between women\u2019s employment and their age at marriage? And how did the notion that women could have a career and a family evolve? So, the first issue is centered on the history of women, work, and family.", "The other part concerns equity: equity between couples and gender equity in terms of pay, promotion, and occupation. Gender gaps in earnings and employment have narrowed considerably but remain. ", "Why?", "At some point, I realized that these two parts of the story must be brought together. ", "The book", " emphasizes the enormous progress we have made. Yet, it also demonstrates what is preventing us from going the \u201clast mile.\u201d It is only because we have made enormous progress in education and employment, and that many of the obvious barriers have been taken down, that the reasons for the remaining differences have become so clear.", "The book was begun long before the pandemic, but it took on new urgency with the lockdown. Everything that I had been saying about the reasons for the remaining differences became clearer during the pandemic. When schools closed, burdens increased for all parents. Fortunate workers sheltered at home and could retain their jobs. The pandemic magnified the factors raised in the book\u2014the importance of flexible work, the career cost of children to women, and the cost to women of couple inequity regarding unequal division of work and family.", "Based on your research how have things changed or not changed for women in the workplace?", "One first needs to know the period to locate change for women in the workplace. Change in women\u2019s labor force participation, occupations, and earnings have been stupendous since 1900. Change has also been enormous since 1950 and even since 1970. But change in some areas has not been large enough since, say, 2000. The labor force participation rate of women\u2014of just about all education groups and almost all age groups\u2014has been stuck. (The only group of women who have experienced significant increased participation are women older than around 55 years in the period from 1990 to around the 2010s.) The gender earnings gap has narrowed somewhat in the last two decades, but not by as much as it did before. That may be understandable since it narrowed by a lot. But it does appear a bit stuck. Why that is the case is part of the book. The other part of the book concerns the change that came before. Let me discuss that a bit.", "The book divides the past century or more of college graduate women into five distinct groups and shows the enormous changes that occurred as we move from one to the next.", "The five groups differed greatly in their outcomes\u2014their marriage rates, their birth rates, their occupations, and their employment. They shifted from being able to have ", "either", " a career or a family to expecting to have ", "both", " a career and a family.", "Understanding this history clears the air and allows us to see the next steps. The history is needed to comprehend how barriers and norms first appear and later disappear, and how change in the greater economy and society impacts women.", "One part of gender differences that gets considerable attention today is the earnings gap. We generally express the gender earnings gap as a single number (by \u201cwe\u201d I mean the US Bureau of Labor Statistics). It is expressed as the ratio of female to male weekly earnings for those working full-time, year-round. Furthermore, the ratio is the median woman\u2019s earnings divided by that of the median man. That\u2019s a mouthful. The ratio is less than the actual numbers because there is some attempt to control for hours worked and to trim the long right tail (earnings at the top) by using the median. ", "Expressed this way, there has been great progress, particularly in the 1980s. Much of the progress has come about because women\u2019s education and job experience greatly advanced relative to men\u2019s. They prepared themselves better for demanding jobs and they stayed in the workforce more. Thus, there has been considerable progress. ", "But there is also considerable frustration that there hasn\u2019t been more. The frustration has been expressed in terms of doing something about sexual harassment, biased managers, and absence of information on the salaries of others. But, although these are noble goals, they aren\u2019t going to make a big difference closing the remaining gender gap in earnings. The reason is that it is largely due to the impact of \u201cgreedy work\u201d and how couples adjust to it.", "What are the key challenges of improving what you call couple equity?", "The employee who is willing to work at all hours\u2014in the evenings, on weekends, on vacations, and is on-call at the office\u2014gets the bigger rewards. When these rewards are ", "disproportionate", " to the time put in, meaning that doubling the time, more than doubles the earnings, we get \u201cgreedy work.\u201d It isn\u2019t necessarily the number of hours, it is often \u201cwhich\u201d hours (weekend, vacation, dinner time, evening). And the relationship can also be dynamic and be part of the \u201cup or out\u201d system common to many high-end employments. Work more now, and get big rewards in the future (e.g., partner, tenure, first promotion).", "If an individual has children or some other family responsibilities, someone must be on-call at home, even if that person has a job. The \u201con-call at home\u201d person will take a position that has more flexibility and is less demanding and, in consequence, pays less even on a per hour basis.", "Women are generally the ones who are on-call at home. That\u2019s couple inequity. Thus, the flip side to couple inequity is gender inequality. Even same-sex couples with children encounter a strong pull toward this type of specialization and often jettison couple equity (but do not add to gender inequality). ", "Why can\u2019t dual-career families share the joys and duties of parenting equally? They could, but if they did, they would be leaving money on the table, often quite a lot. The 50-50 couple might be happier, but it would be poorer. ", "If work were less greedy the price of couple equity would be reduced. That can come about in a variety of ways some occurring organically and some because workers use voice and exit. For example, groups have been formed so that professionals in medical fields like pediatrics and obstetrics, can have more flexibility.", "The pandemic has lowered the cost of flexibility in various ways. Firms and workers have learned to use technologies that enable remote meetings,", " ", "including those with huge numbers of participants. Even though we\u2019ve had teleconferencing software since the 1990s, we didn\u2019t greatly depend on these tools until recently. The number of work hours may remain the same, but employees have more control over which hours are free, like the ones just before a child goes to bed or when the family eats dinner together. If a meeting with a client in Tokyo or Beijing can be effectively done without ever getting on a plane, the parent who needs to be home at night can take that job\u2014and that individual is likely to be a woman."], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanwai/", "author_name": null, "author_contrib_type": null, "author_subcontext_header": null, "author_about": "", "author_social_links": []}},

Always.\u201d) Looked at from that perspective, this is also a tale of the big brains and big egos that drive the crypto world\u2013and of a hacker who may have justified his actions by telling himself he simply did what the faulty code baked into The DAO allowed him to do. ", "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", "I", "n early 2016, the Ethereum network was not even a year old, and there was only one app on it that people were interested in: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund built with a smart contract that gave its token holders the right to vote on proposals submitted for funding. It had been created by a company named Slock.it, which, instead of seeking traditional venture capital, had decided to create this DAO and then open it up for crowdfunding\u2014with the expectation that its own project would be one of those funded by The DAO. Slock.it\u2019s team thought The DAO might attract $5 million.", "Yet when the crowd sale opened on April 30", "th", ", it took in $9 million in just the first two days, with participants exchanging one ether for 100 DAO tokens. As the money poured in, some on the team felt queasy, but it was too late to cap the sale.\u00a0By the time the funding closed a month later, 15,000 to 20,000 individuals had contributed, The DAO held what was then 15% of all ether and the price of the cryptocurrency was steadily rising. At the same time, a variety of security and structural concerns were being raised about The DAO, including one that would, ironically, later prove to be crucial to limiting the hacker\u2019s immediate access to the spoils. That problem: withdrawing funds was too hard. Someone wanting to retrieve their money had to first create a \u201cchild DAO\u201d or \u201csplit DAO,\u201d which required not only a high degree of technical knowledge, but also waiting periods after each step and the agreement of anyone else who moved funds into that child DAO.", "On the morning of June 17th, ETH reached a new all-time high of $21.52, making the crypto in The DAO worth $249.6 million. When American Griff Green woke up that morning in Mittweida, Germany (he was staying in the family home of two brothers who were Slock.it cofounders), he had a message on his phone from a DAO Slack community member who said something weird was happening\u2014 it looked like funds were being drained. Green, Slock.it\u2019s first employee and community organizer, checked: there was indeed a stream of 258-ETH (then $5,600) transactions leaving The DAO. ", "\u00a0", "By the time the attack stopped a few hours later, 31% of the ETH in The DAO had been siphoned out into the DarkDAO. As awareness of the attack spread, ether had its highest trading day ever, with its price plummeting 33% from $21 to $14.", "Split Fortunes ", "The 2016 DAO crowdfunding sale drove the price of ether (ETH) to a then record high\u2014until the June 17th attack on The DAO sent it plummeting. After the hard fork on July 20th, the old blockchain began trading as ether classic (ETC). ", "Soon, the Ethereum community pinpointed the vulnerability that enabled this theft: the DAO smart contract had been written so that any time someone withdrew money, the smart contract would send the money first, before updating that person\u2019s balance. The attacker had used a malicious smart contract that withdrew money (258 ETH at a time), then interfered with the updating of the contract, allowing them to withdraw the same ether again and again. It was as if the attacker had $101 in their bank account, withdrew $100 at a bank, then kept the bank teller from updating the balance to $1, and again requested and received another $100.", "Even worse, once the vulnerability became public, the remaining 7.3 million ETH in The DAO was at risk of a copycat attack. A team of white hat hackers (that is, hackers acting ethically)\u00a0formed and used the attacker\u2019s method to divert the remaining funds into a new child DAO.\u00a0But the attacker still had about 5% of all outstanding ETH, and even the rescued ether was vulnerable, given the flaws in The DAO. Plus, the clock was ticking down to a July 21", "st", " deadline\u2014the first date when the original hacker might be able to get at the funds they had diverted into the DarkDao. If the community wanted to keep the attacker from cashing out, they would need to put tokens in the hacker\u2019s DarkDAO and then in any future \u201csplit DAOs\u201d (or child DAOs) the unknown hacker created. (Under the rules of the DAO smart contract, the attacker couldn\u2019t withdraw funds if anyone else in their split DAO objected.) Bottom line: if the white hats ever missed their window to object, the attacker would be able to abscond with the funds\u2014meaning this informal group would have to be constantly vigilant.", "Eventually, after much bickering (on Reddit, on a Slack channel, over email and on Skype calls) and Ethereum founder Buterin publicly weighing in, and after it seemed that a majority of the Ethereum community supported the measure, Ethereum did a \u201chard fork.\u201d On July 20", "th", " the Ethereum blockchain was split into two. All the ETH that had been in the DAO was moved to a \u201cwithdraw\u201d contract which gave the original contributors the right to send in their DAO tokens and get back ETH on the new blockchain.

", "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", "O", "n Ethereum Classic, The DAO and the attacker\u2019s loot (in the form of 3.64 million ETC) remained. That summer, the attacker moved their ETC a few hops away to a new wallet, which remained dormant until late October, when they began trying to use an exchange called ShapeShift to cash the money out to bitcoin. Because ShapeShift didn\u2019t at that time take personally identifying information, the attacker\u2019s identity was not known even though all their blockchain movements were visible. Over the next two months, the hacker managed to obtain 282 bitcoins (then worth $232,000, now more than $11 million). And then, perhaps because ShapeShift frequently blocked their attempted trades, they gave up cashing out, leaving behind 3.4 million Ether Classic (ETC), then worth $3.2 million and now more than $100 million.", "That might have been the end of the story\u2014an unknown hacker sitting on a fortune he couldn\u2019t cash out. Except last July, one of my sources involved in the DAO rescue, a Brazilian named Alex Van de Sande (aka Avsa) reached out, saying the Brazilian Police had opened an investigation into the attack on The DAO \u2014 and whether he might be a victim or even the hacker himself.\u00a0 Van de Sande decided to commission a forensics report from blockchain analytics company Coinfirm to help exonerate himself (though then, the police closed the investigation, he said). In case any similar situations arose in the future, he went forward with the report examining those cash-out attempts in 2016.", "Among the early suspects\u00a0in the hack had been a Swiss businessman and his associates, and in tracing the funds, Van de Sande and I also found another suspect: a Russia-based Ethereum Classic developer. But all these people were in Europe/Russia and the cash-outs mapped onto an Asian-morning-through-evening schedule\u2014from 9 A.M. to midnight Tokyo time\u2014when the Europeans were likely sleeping. (The timing of their social media posts suggested they kept fairly normal hours.)\u00a0But based on a customer support email the hacker had submitted to ShapeShift in the leadup to the attack, I believed they spoke fluent English.", "Jumping off from the Coinfirm analysis, blockchain analytics company Chainalysis saw the presumed attacker had sent 50 BTC to a Wasabi Wallet, a private desktop Bitcoin wallet that aims to anonymize transactions by mixing several together", " ", "in a so-called CoinJoin. Using a capability that is being disclosed here for the first time, Chainalysis de-mixed the Wasabi transactions and tracked their output to four exchanges.

Singapore time.", "And the email address used on that account at the exchange was [name of exchange]@toby.ai.", "In May 2016, as it was finishing up its historic fundraise, Hoenisch was intensely interested in The DAO. On May 12, he emailed Hosp a tip (\u201cProfitable crypto trade coming up\u201d) to short ETH once the DAO crowdfunding period ended. On May 17th and 18", "th", ", in the DAO Slack channel, he engaged in a long conversation in which he made, depending on how you count, 52 comments, minimum, about vulnerabilities in The DAO, getting into various aspects of the code and nitpicking over exactly what was possible given the way the code was structured.", "One issue spurred him to email Slock.it\u2019s chief technology officer, Christoph Jentzsch, its lead technical engineer, Lefteris Karapetsas, and community manager Griff Green. In his email, he said he was writing a proposal for funding from The DAO for a crypto card product called DAO.PAY, and added, \u201cFor our due diligence, we went through the DAO code and found a few things that are worrisome.\u201d He outlined three possible attack vectors and later emailed with a fourth. Jentzsch, a German who had been working on a PhD in physics before dropping out to focus on Ethereum, responded point by point, conceding some of Hoenisch\u2019s assertions but saying others were \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t work.\u201d\u00a0The back and forth ended with Hoenisch writing;\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll keep you in the loop if we find anything else.\u201d", "But instead of further email exchanges, on May 28", "th", ", Hoenish wrote four posts on Medium, beginning with, \u201cTheDAO\u2014risk free voting.\u201d The second, \u201cTheDAO\u2014blackmailing withdrawals,\u201d foreshadowed the main issue with The DAO and why Ethereum ultimately chose to hard fork: if it did not, the only other options were to let the attacker cash out his ill-gotten gains or for some group of DAO token holders to follow him forever into new split DAOs he created as he attempted to cash out. \u201cTLDR: If you end upon in a DAO contract without majority voting power, then an attacker can block all withdrawals indefinitely,\u201d he wrote. The third showed how an attacker could do this cheaply.", "His last, most telling post for the day, \u201cTheDAO\u2014a $150m lesson in decentralized governance,\u201d said DAO.PAY decided against making a proposal after uncovering \u201cmajor security flaws\u201d and that \u201cSlockit down-played the severity of the attack vectors.\u201d He wrote, \u201cTheDAO is live \u2026 and we are still waiting for Slockit to put out a warning that THERE IS NO SAFE WAY TO WITHDRAW!\u201d", "On June 3, his last Medium post, \u201cAnnouncing BlockOps: Blockchain Hack Challenges\u201d said, \u201cBlockOps is your playground to break encryption, steal bitcoin, break smart contracts and simply test your security knowledge.\u201d Although he promised to \u201cpost new challenges in the field of bitcoin, ethereum and web security every 2 weeks,\u201d I could find no record that he did so.", "Two weeks later came the DAO attack. The morning after the attack, at 7:18 A.M. Singapore time, Hoenisch trolled Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin by retweeting something Buterin had said before The DAO was attacked, but after it was known that the vulnerability used in the attack was evident in the DAO\u2019s code. In the two-week old tweet, Buterin had said that he\u2019d been buying DAO tokens since the security news. Over the following weeks, Hoenisch tweeted anti-hard fork posts like one titled, \u201cToo Big to Fail is Failure Guaranteed.\u201d ", "Curiously, on July 5, a couple weeks after the attack, Hoenisch and Karapetsas exchanged Reddit DMs titled \u201cDarkDAO counter attack\u201d \u2014 though the substance of the messages is unclear because Hoensich has deleted all his Reddit posts. (Hosp recalls that Hoenisch told him he had deleted his Reddit account after an altercation with an \u201cidiot\u201d on Reddit over The DAO.) Hoenisch wrote, \u201cSorry for not contacting first. I got carried away from finding it and telling the community that there is a way to fight back. In any case, I don't see any way the attacker can use this.\u201d", "After Karapetsas told Hoenisch of the white hats\u2019 plans to protect what was left in The DAO, Hoenisch replied, \u201cI took down the post.\u201d Karapetsas responded, \u201cI will keep you up to date with what we do from now on.\u201d Hoenisch\u2019s last message in that exchange: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I messed up the plan.\u201d", "On July 24th, the day after the Ethereum Classic chain revived and began trading on Poloniex, Hoenisch tweeted, \u201cethereum drama escalating: from #daowars to #chainwars. Ethereum classic now traded on poloniex as $ETC and miners planning attacks.\u201d On July 26th, he retweeted Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of the powerful and well-respected Digital Currency Group, who had tweeted, \u201cBought my first non-bitcoin digital currency\u2026Ethereum Classic (ETC).\u201d", "Upon hearing the name Toby Hoenisch, without knowing evidence indicated he was the DAO attacker, Karapetsas, a usually good-humored Greek software developer who was one of the DAO creators and had engaged with him by email and on Reddit, said: \u201cHe was obnoxious\u2026. he was quite insistent on having found a lot of problems.\u201d After hearing that the DarkDAO ETC had been cashed out to a Grin node with Hoenisch\u2019s alias, Karapetsas observed that if Hoenisch had instead remedied the situation while the DarkDao funds were frozen, the Ethereum community would have given him \u201chuge kudos'' for finding the weakness and then returning the ETH. Similarly, Griff Green, whose current projects lean towards helping non-profit and public causes grow in the digital world, believes the hacker missed the chance to \u201cbe a hero.\u201d Says Green: \u201cHe really screwed the pooch...Reputation is way more valuable than money.\u201d", "Ironically, in a 2016 blog post, Hoenisch wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a white hat hacker by heart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0Twenty days later came the DAO attack.", "As I noted earlier,\u00a0after being sent a document laying out the evidence that he was the hacker and asking for comment for my book, Hoenisch wrote that my conclusion is \u201cfactually inaccurate.\u201d He said in that email he could give me more details\u2014and then did not respond to four requests for those details, nor to additional fact checking queries for this article.\u00a0In addition, after receiving the first document detailing the facts I\u2019d gathered, he deleted almost all his Twitter history (though I\u2019ve saved the relevant tweets).

They started making the card available that year on an invitation-only basis, because, as Hoenisch explained on Reddit, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to launch a half-assed Bitcoin wallet that gets us in trouble for violating KYC (know your customer) laws. And yes, legal is the main reason we can\u2019t just ship it.\u201d A ", "Bitcoin Magazine ", "article at the time said Hoenisch had a background in AI, IT security and cryptography.", "In early 2017, just months after the presumed DAO attacker stopped trying to cash out their ETC, Hoenisch\u2019s team\u2014by then operating as TenX\u2014announced it had received $1 million in seed funding from (among others) Fenbushi Capital, where Ethereum founder Buterin was a general partner. Then came the $80 million ICO. In early 2018, things started to go south for TenX when its card issuer, Wavecrest, was booted from the Visa network, meaning that TenX's users could no longer use their debit cards. ", "On Oct. 1, 2020, TenX announced it was sunsetting its services because its new card issuer, Wirecard SG, had been directed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to cease operations.\u00a0On April 9, 2021, TenX posted a blog called \u201cTenX, Meet Mimo.\u201d It outlined a new business that would offer a euro-pegged stablecoin, which kept its value pegged to a fiat currency such as US dollars or euros or Japanese Yen. The market cap of TenX tokens, which spiked at $535 million, now sits at just $11 million. TenX has rebranded itself as Mimo Capital and is offering holders of TenX tokens mostly worthless MIMO tokens instead at a rate of 0.37 MIMO for each TenX.", "Hosp, who was the public face of the company while there, was booted by Hoenisch and another cofounder in January 2019. This occurred a couple months after some crypto publications reported on Hosp\u2019s past affiliation with an Austrian multi-level marketing scheme. However, before hearing that evidence indicated Hoenisch was the DAO attacker, Hosp said his feeling had been that Hoenisch had perhaps pushed him out over jealousy that Hosp had sold bitcoin at the top of the bubble in late 2017, netting himself $20 million. Meanwhile, Hoenisch had kept all his crypto as the bubble \u2013 and his personal net worth \u2013 deflated. ", "\u201cHe came from a very poor family, he had no experience in investing, and he was in crypto in 2010 but he had literally no money, nothing, when we were in Las Vegas together [in the summer of 2016] he had nothing, and I was doing really well with my investments\u2026 he would always push for getting more salary, for having something nicer.\u201d Hosp also mentioned Hoenisch had to send money home to his mother, who had raised him, as well as his sister and brother, as a single parent.", "Upon hearing that Hoenisch was the likely DAO attacker, Hosp said he was \u201cgetting goose bumps\u201d and begin recalling details from his interactions with his former partner that now seemed to take on new significance.\u00a0For example, when asked if Hoenisch was into Grin (the privacy coins to which the hacker had cashed out) Hosp said, \u201cYes! Yes, he was. He was fascinated by that\u2026I lost money because of those stupid coins! I invested in them because of him, because he was so fascinated by them.\u201d He said that Hoenisch was also obsessed with building a Bitcoin/Monero \u201catomic swap\u201d \u2013 or a way to use smart contracts to swap between Bitcoin and the privacy coin Monero. At the time, Hosp was confused by that, because he felt there was no market for such a product. Later, Hosp pulled up chats from August 2016, in which Hoenisch seemed excited about the price of ETC, the coin held by the hacker after the ethereum fork. ", "When trying to recall the incident that he believed prompted Hoenisch to close his Reddit, Hosp began searching on his computer and muttered to himself, \u201cHe always used tobyai.\u201d He confirmed that one of Toby\u2019s regular email addresses ended in @toby.ai. ", "Recalled a still astounded Hosp: \u201cFor some weird reason, he was quite well aware of what was happening\u2026He understood more of the DAO hack when I asked him what had happened\u2026than I had found on the internet or anywhere.\u201d", " ", "MORE FROM FORBES"], "author_var_dict": {"author_forbes_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/", "author_name": null, "author_contrib_type": null, "author_subcontext_header": null, "author_about": "", "author_social_links": []}},
